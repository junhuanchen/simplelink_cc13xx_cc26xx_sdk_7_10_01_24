## Introduction

The oad_image_tool adds the OAD metadata to an image to prepare it for
over the transfer. The OAD metadata is a collection of information about the image
including length, start address, and crc that will be used throughout the OAD Process.

The toad_image_tool adds delta image metadata to the OAD binary, and performs
delta encoding and image compression on the binary. Delta images should only be
used for devices that have Turbo OAD enabled for the respective OAD protocol.

This tool is intended to run as a post build step. Please refer to the
Turbo OAD enabled sample applications to for a reference invocation of the tool.

Further documentation can be found the SDK's User Guide. There is a chapter
dedicated to Turbo OAD which will cover the tool.
