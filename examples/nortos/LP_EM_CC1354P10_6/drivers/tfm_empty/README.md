## Example Summary

This example is intended to be a starting point for new development where
a fuller set of kernel features and debug capabilities are enabled.

The project is configured to use the non-secure linker files and libraries.
To use this project, you will also need to flash the secure image to the
device.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

When this project is built, the SysConfig tool will generate the TI-Driver
configurations into the __ti_drivers_config.c__ and __ti_drivers_config.h__
files. Information on pins and resources used is present in both generated
files. Additionally, the System Configuration file (\*.syscfg) present in the
project may be opened with SysConfig's graphical user interface to determine
pins and resources used.

* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0`

## BoosterPacks, Board Resources & Jumper Settings

For board specific jumper settings, resources and BoosterPack modifications,
refer to the __Board.html__ file.

> If you're using an IDE such as Code Composer Studio (CCS) or IAR, please
refer to Board.html in your project directory for resources used and
board-specific jumper settings.

The Board.html can also be found in your SDK installation:

        <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/<BOARD>

## Example Usage

* Steps to run the example:
  1. Launch the CCS debug session.
  2. Select *Tools* -> *Debugger Options* -> *Auto Run and Launch Options*. Disable Auto
   Run Option "On a program load or restart". Set "Remember My Settings" to
   allow this setting to persist for subsequent debug sessions.
  3. Exit and relaunch the debug session. Execution should be paused at `_c_int00()`.
   Steps 2 & 3 can be skipped for subsequent debug sessions.
  4. Select *Run* -> *Load* -> *Load Program*.  Select `tfm_s.axf` located in
   `<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tfm_s/build/cc26x4/production_full/Release/outputs/CC26X4/`
   to program the Secure image.  This will overwrite the NS application symbols.
   5. To restore NS application symbols: Select *Run* -> *Load* -> *Add Symbols*.  Select the NS application `tfm_empty_XXXX.out`.
   6. PC register should be 0xD100 (Secure entry point) if above steps were done
   correctly.
   7. Set breakpoints if desired and resume execution to run the example.
* The example lights `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` as part of the initialization in the
`mainThread()`. This thread then toggles the LED at a 1 second rate.

## Application Design Details

Security and TrustZone:

* Refer to the `TI Trusted Firmware-M User Guide` in `docs/tfm for
general information on using security features.

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.
