Thread Synchronization
----------------------

The |TIRTOS| kernel provides several modules for synchronizing tasks such as
Semaphore, Event, and Queue. The following sections discuss these common
|TIRTOS| primitives.

.. _sec-rtos-semaphores:

Semaphores
^^^^^^^^^^

Semaphores are commonly used for task synchronization and mutual exclusions
throughout |TIRTOS| applications. :numref:`fig-semaphore` shows the semaphore
functionality. Semaphores can be counting semaphores or binary semaphores.
Counting semaphores keep track of the number of times the semaphore is posted
with ``Semaphore_post()``. When a group of resources are shared between tasks,
this function is useful. Such tasks might call ``Semaphore_pend()`` to see if a
resource is available before using one. Binary semaphores can have only two
states: available (count = 1) and unavailable (count = 0). Binary semaphores
can be used to share a single resource between tasks or for a basic-signaling
mechanism where the semaphore can be posted multiple times. Binary semaphores
do not keep track of the count; they track only whether the semaphore has been
posted.

    Semaphore Functionality

Initializing a Semaphore
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The following code depicts how a semaphore is initialized in |TIRTOS|.
Semaphores can be *created* and *constructed* as explained in
:ref:`create_vs_construct`.

See :numref:`create-example-listing` on how to create a Semaphore.

See :numref:`construct-example-listing` on how to construct a Semaphore.

Pending on a Semaphore
""""""""""""""""""""""

``Semaphore_pend()`` is a blocking function call. This call may only be called
from within a Task context. A task calling this function will allow lower
priority tasks to execute, if they are ready to run. A task calling
``Semaphore_pend()`` will block if its counter is 0, otherwise it will
decrement the counter by one. The task will remain blocked until another thread
calls ``Semaphore_post()`` or if the supplied system tick timeout has occurred;
whichever comes first. By reading the return value of ``Semaphore_pend()`` it
is possible to distinguish if a semaphore was posted or if it timed out.

    bool isSuccessful;
    uint32_t timeout = 1000 * (1000/Clock_tickPeriod);

    /* Pend (approximately) up to 1 second */
    isSuccessful = Semaphore_pend(sem, timeoutInTicks);

    if (isSuccessful)
    {
        System_printf("Semaphore was posted");
    }
    else
    {
        System_printf("Semaphore timed out");
    }

.. ifconfig:: device in ['cc13x0', 'cc2640']

    The following example shows the
    minimum resolution is the TI-RTOS clock tick period set in the TI-RTOS
    configuration file (``.cfg``).

    .. note::
        The default TI-RTOS kernel tick period is 1 millisecond. For |DEVICE|
        devices, this is reconfigured in the TI-RTOS configuration file
        (``.cfg``)::

            Clock.tickPeriod = 10;

.. ifconfig:: device == 'cc13xx_cc26xx'

    The following example shows the
    minimum resolution of the TI-RTOS clock tick period as configured via
    SysConfig in the TI-RTOS configuration panel.

    .. note::
        The default TI-RTOS kernel tick period is 1 millisecond. For |DEVICE|
        devices, this is reconfigured by SysConfig inside ``TI-RTOS`` |rarr|
        ``Core Kernel`` |rarr| ``Clock``, where
        ``Clock Tick Period in microseconds`` is set to 10.

Posting a Semaphore
"""""""""""""""""""

Posting a semaphore is accomplished via a call to ``Semaphore_post()``. A task
that is pending on a posted semaphore will transition from a *blocked* state to
a *ready* state. If no higher priority thread is *ready* to run, it will allow
the previously pending task to execute. If no task is pending on the semaphore,
a call to ``Semaphore_post()`` will increment its counter. Binary semaphores
have a maximum count of 1.

.. _posting-semaphore-listing:
.. code-block:: c

    :caption: Posting a Semaphore
    :emphasize-lines: 1

    Semaphore_post(sem);

.. _sec-rtos-overview-event:

Event
^^^^^

Semaphores themselves provide rudimentary synchronization between threads.
There are cases just the Semaphore itself is enough to understand on what
process needs to be triggered. Often however, a specific causes for the
synchronization need to be passed across threads as well. To help accomplish
this, one can utilize the |TIRTOS| **Event** module.

Events are similar to Semaphores in a sense that each instance of an Event
object actually contains a Semaphore. The added advantage of using Events lie
in the fact that tasks can be notified of specific events in a thread-safe
manner.

Initializing an Event
"""""""""""""""""""""

*Creating* and *constructing* Events follow the same guidelines as explained in
:ref:`create_vs_construct`. Shown in :numref:`event-initialize-listing` is an
example on how to *construct* an Event instance.

.. _event-initialize-listing:
.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:
    :caption: Constructing an Event
    :emphasize-lines: 6

    Event_Handle event;
    Event_Params eventParams;
    Event_Struct structEvent; /* Memory allocated at build time */

    Event_Params_init(&eventParams);
    Event_construct(&structEvent, 0, &eventParams);

    /* It's optional to store the handle */
    event = Event_handle(&structEvent);

Pending on an Event
"""""""""""""""""""

Similar to ``Semaphore_pend()``, a Task thread would typically block on an
``Event_pend()`` until an event is posted via an ``Event_post()`` or if the
specified timeout expired. Shown in :numref:`pending-event-listing` is a
snippet of a task pending on *any* of the 3 sample event IDs shown below.
``BIOS_WAIT_FOREVER`` is used to prevent a timeout from occurring. As a result,
``Event_pend()`` will have one or more events posted in the returned bit-masked
value.

Each event returned from ``Event_pend()`` has been automatically cleared within
the event instance in a thread-safe manner. Therefore, it is only necessary to
keep a local copy of posted events. For full details on how to use
``Event_pend()``, see the |TI-RTOS_UG|.

Posting an Event
""""""""""""""""

Events may be posted from any |TIRTOS| kernel contexts and is simply done by
calling ``Event_post()`` of the Event instance and the Event ID.

could post a specific event.
