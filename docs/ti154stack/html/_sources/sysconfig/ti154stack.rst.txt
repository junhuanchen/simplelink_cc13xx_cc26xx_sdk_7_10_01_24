15.4-Stack Configuration
========================

These instructions are valid for all 15.4-Stack project examples

.. note::

    SysConfig will only make changes to selected files, listed in the
    *Generated Files* view. Any required changes to your application files 
    must be done on your own.


Open An Example Project
-----------------------

Open the stand-alone SysConfig tool or import a SysConfig-enabled example project 
(found in the ``{SDK_INSTALL_DIR}/examples`` folder) and open the 
``.syscfg`` file with the *System Configuration Editor*.

TI 15.4 Stack Settings
----------------------

In the *RF STACKS* |rarr| *TI 15.4 Stack* view you can configure 15.4-Stack parameters.
Parameters are explained in the tooltip that appears when you hover over it but
further explanations are provided in the :ref:`sec-config-parameters`.
15.4-Stack settings are stored in ``ti_154stack_config.h``.

Adjust Your Application
-----------------------

When you have finished adjusting the parameters, save the ``.syscfg`` file and
generate the files (top-right corner of the *System Configuration Editor* window).

You can see the generated files by clicking the ``<>`` symbol. In this example,
``ti_devices_config.c`` and ``ti_drivers_config.c/h`` were generated by the *TI DRIVERS* view,
``ti_radio_config.c/h`` was generated by the *RF Stacks* and ``ti_154stack_config.h``
was generated by the *TI 15.4 Stack* view.

If you are using the System Configuration stand-alone tool, you will have to
import every generated file to your IDE.  For the SysConfig :term:`CCS` plug-in, 
you can generate all the files by building your project. After the build has 
completed, you will find the generated files in the output folder of your project, 
called "Release/syscfg".  All parameters configured in the 15.4 Stack view of 
SysConfig will result in a \#define in ``ti_154stack_config.h`` alongside other macros 
which are not included in SysConfig.

.. attention::

    Whenever you re-build the project, SysConfig will re-generate the files.
    Because of this, any changes made directly to ``ti_154stack_config.h`` will be overwritten.
