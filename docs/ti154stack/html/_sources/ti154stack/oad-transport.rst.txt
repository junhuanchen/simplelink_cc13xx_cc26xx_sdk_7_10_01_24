  TI 15.4-Stack OAD Block Diagram

Modules
^^^^^^^

TI 15.4-Stack OAD comprises of the following software modules:

-   OAD Protocol Module
-   OAD Storage Module
-   OAD Client Module

The OAD server module is simpler than the OAD client, and does not need to
handle events, error conditions, or retries. The OAD server functionality is
embedded into the existing Linux collector module. 

OAD Protocol Module
-------------------

The OAD protocol interface provides device independent APIs, data types, and
macros. The Over the Air Download (OAD) protocol module provides protocol
functionality for transferring an OAD image. The APIs in this module serve as an
interface to a |TIRTOS| application and offers functionality for an OAD messaging
protocol between OAD sever and the OAD client. The module handles the formatting
and parsing of messages.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use the OAD protocol APIs, the application is required to provide
application specific configuration and callbacks. For the application to process
OAD Messages the following callback table must be provided::

  /** @brief OADProtocol callback table
   *
   */
  typedef struct
  {
      fwVersionReqCb_t      pfnFwVersionReqCb; ///< Incoming FW Req
      fwVersionRspCb_t      pfnFwVersionRspCb; ///< Incoming FW Version Rsp
      oadImgIdentifyReqCb_t pfnOadImgIdentifyReqCb; ///< Incoming Image Identify Req
      oadImgIdentifyRspCb_t pfnOadImgIdentifyRspCb; ///< Incoming Image Identify Rsp
      oadBlockReqCb_t       pfnOadBlockReqCb; ///< Incoming OAD Block Req
      oadBlockRspCb_t       pfnOadBlockRspCb; ///< Incoming OAD Block Rsp
  } OADProtocol_MsgCBs_t;

For the OAD module to allocate buffers and send messages the following platform
specific callback must be provided::

  /** @brief OADProtocol radio access functions
   *
   */
  typedef struct
  {
      radioAccessAllocMsg_t        pfnRadioAccessAllocMsg;   ///< Function for allocating a message buffer
      radioAccessPacketSend_t      pfnRadioAccessPacketSend; ///< Function for sending message over the radio
  } OADProtocol_RadioAccessFxns_t;

``OADProtocol_init()`` must be called before any other OADProtocol APIs. The
following parametric configuration is passed::

  /** @brief RF parameter struct
   *  RF parameters are used with the OADProtocol_open() and OADProtocol_Params_init() call.
   */
  typedef struct {
      OADProtocol_RadioAccessFxns_t  *pRadioAccessFxns;    ///< Radio access function table
      OADProtocol_MsgCBs_t           *pProtocolMsgCallbacks;          ///< Application Callbacks for pressing packets
  } OADProtocol_Params_t;

Application Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OAD protocol module formats and parses the OAD messages. The following API
are exposed::

  /** @brief  Function to initialize the OADProtocol_Params struct to its defaults
   *
   *  @param  params      An pointer to RF_Params structure for
   *                      initialization
   *
   *  Defaults values are:
   *     pRadioAccessFxns     = {0}
   *      pCallbacks          = {0}
   */
  extern void OADProtocol_Params_init(OADProtocol_Params_t *params);

  /** @brief  Function that initializes the Wsn Protocol Task and creates all TI-RTOS objects
   *
   */
  extern void OADProtocol_init(void);

  /** @brief  Function to open the OADProtocol module

  extern OADProtocol_Status_t OADProtocol_sendFwVersionReq(void* pDstAddress);

  /** @brief  Function to send a FW version response packet

  extern OADProtocol_Status_t OADProtocol_sendFwVersionRsp(void* pDstAddress, char *fwVersion);

  /** @brief  Function to send an OAD image identify request packet

   *
   */
  extern OADProtocol_Status_t OADProtocol_sendOadImgBlockRsp(void* pDstAddress, uint8_t imgId, uint16_t blockNum, uint8_t *block);

Usage
^^^^^

To use the OAD protocol module to format and parse OAD messages, the application
calls the following APIs:

  - OADProtocol_init(): Initialize the OADProtocol module/task

  - OADProtocol_Params_init(): Initialize a OADProtocol_Params structure with
    default values. Then change the parameters from non-default values as
    needed.

  - OADProtocol_open(): Open an instance of the OADProtocol module, passing the
    initialized parameters.

  - OADProtocol_sendFwRequest(): This is an example of an OAD message that is
    formatted and sent.

The following code example opens OADProtocol, sends a FW version request and
processes the response.::

  OADProtocol_packetCBs_t OADProtocolCbs = {
    NULL, //Incoming FW Req
    fwVersionReqCb, //Incoming FW Version Rsp
    NULL, //Incoming Image Identify Req
    NULL, //Incoming Image Identify Rsp
    NULL, //Incoming OAD Block Req
    NULL, //Incoming OAD Block Rsp
  };

  static void fwVersionRspCb(uint16_t srcAddr, char *fwVersionStr)
  {
    //Do something with srcAddr and fwVersionStr
  }

  void someTaskInit(void)
  {
    OADProtocol_init();
  }

  void someTaskFxn(void)
  {
    // Set Default parameters structure
    static OADProtocol_Params_t OADProtocol_params;

    // Initialize and open the Wsn Protocol Task
    OADProtocol_Params_init(&OADProtocol_params);
    OADProtocol_params.pCallbacks = &OADProtocolCbs;
    OADProtocol_open(&OADProtocol_params);

    OADProtocol_sendFwVersionReq(nodeAddress);

  }

OAD Storage Module
------------------

The OAD storage interface provides device independent APIs, data types, and
macros for storing the OAD image. The OAD storage module calls into oad_target,
which provide the device dependent functionality to write the OAD image into
flash. oad_target contains the support for internal (on-chip) and external
(off-chip) OAD image storage.

OAD Storage Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The oad_target module can be configured at build time to use on-chip or off-chip
storage by linking or copying in the correct target c file:

-   ``oad_target_external_flash.c``
-   ``oad_target_internal_flash.c``

.. note:: For on-chip OAD, the OAD storage module must be built with
    ``FEATURE_OAD_ONCHIP`` defined.


Initilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``OADStorage_init()`` must be called before any other OADTarget APIs.

Application Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OAD storage module exposes the following API for staring the OAD image::

  /*********************************************************************
   * @fn      OADStorage_init
   *
   * @brief   Initialise the OAD Target Profile.

   */
  extern void OADStorage_close(void);

OAD Client Module
-----------------

The OAD client module has been designed to provide a simple and customizable
implementation for the customer. In its most rudimentary form, this
module is responsible for accepting/rejecting an OAD interaction based
on image header criteria, storing the image in its appropriate location,
and causing a device reset if the download is successful so that the
downloaded application image is run by the :term:`BIM`.

The OAD client module provides a service to process and generate application
events for OAD client functionality.  It is specific to a TI 15.4-Stack
application and houses the code required for the application to act as an OAD
target, reducing the code needing to be added in the application files. The OAD
client uses the services provided by the OAD protocol and OAD storage modules.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for the OAD client module to process and generate application events it
needs to be initialized with an event handle used to set event masks as they
occur and the applications semaphore that can be used to wake up the
application after an event is set.

``OADClient_init()`` must be called before the module can process OAD events.
The following parametric configuration is passed::

  /** @brief RF parameter struct
   *  RF parameters are used with the SOADProtocol_open() and SOADProtocol_Params_init() call.
   */
  typedef struct {
      uint16_t *pEvent;             ///< Event handle to post to
  #ifdef OSAL_PORT2TIRTOS
      Semaphore_Handle eventSem;    ///< Semaphore to post event
  #else
      ICall_Semaphore eventSem;    ///< Semaphore to post event
  #endif /*OSAL_PORT2TIRTOS */
  } OADClient_Params_t;

Application Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OAD Client module formats and parses the OAD messages. The following
API is exposed::

   /** @brief  Function to open the SOADProtocol module
   *
   *  @param  params      An pointer to OADClient_Params_t structure for initialization
   */
  extern void OADClient_open(OADClient_Params_t *params);

   /** @brief  Function to process OAD events
   *
   *  @param  pEvent      Event to process
   */
  extern void OADClient_processEvent(uint16_t *pEvent);

  /** @brief  Function abort OAD
  *
  *  @param  resume      set to true if a auto resume is required
  */
  void OADClient_abort(bool resume);

  /** @brief  Function abort OAD
  *
  *  @param  delay      time in ms to start resume
  */
  void OADClient_resume(uint32_t delay);

OAD Server
----------

There is no separate tool for the OAD server, OAD server functionality is
provided by the Linux collector application as part of the `TI 15.4-Stack Linux
SDK`_. When the collector application is built without the ``IS_HEADLESS`` flag
an interactive command-line interface to the collector application exposes the
following functionality:

  - Devices can be selected
  - A firmware file can be selected for transfer
  - LED toggle requests can be sent to the selected device
  - Version requests can be sent to the selected device
  - Firmware update requests can be sent to the selected device

A typical view of this interface

.. _sec-oad-pause-and-resume:

OAD Pause and Resume
--------------------

The TI 15.4-Stack OAD feature supports the following robustness features:

#.  Timeouts: This is when a the data request for a block response is not
    answered. The data request delay from an OAD block request being sent is set
    by OAD_BLOCK_REQ_POLL_DELAY ms, it is advised that this be set as short as
    possible to avoid unnecessary queueing of data in the co-processor. A
    timeout is typically caused by the Linux collector taking too long to read
    the OAD Block from the FW Image file (due to CPU load). The number of
    timeouts before a retry is set by OAD_MAX_TIMEOUTS.

#.  Retries: A retry is when the maximum number timeouts has expired before the
    OAD Block Response has been received. In his case the OAD Block Request is
    resent. The number of retires before an OAD abort is set by OAD_MAX_RETRIES.

#.  Aborts: The OAD is aborted after there are OAD_MAX_RETRIES block requests with
    no response. After an OAD abort the OAD is attempted to be resumed after
    OAD_BLOCK_AUTO_RESUME_DELAY ms, if the OAD abort again on the same block number
    the OAD is terminated.

The OAD is aborted if the device orphans, but when the device rejoins an OAD resume
is attempted. If the device is reset / powered off during an OAD the device will
attempt to resume when it rejoins. The block it resumes from is set to the first
block of the page it was aborted from in case the flash page was corrupted by
the power cycle.

Support for multiple OAD files
------------------------------

The OAD protocol supports multiple OAD images by using an Image ID that is sent
when the collector initiates the OAD and then in each OAD block request /
response. This ensures that the device always receives a block from the correct
FW image, especially in the case where a device loses power or orphans and it is
not known when it will come back online. When an OAD image file is selected on
the collector it is assigned a new image ID and added to a table, when a block
request is received the image ID in the block request is used to find the
correct FW image file. This guarantees that a device will always get a block from
the correct image, no matter how long it is offline.

OAD Default Settings
--------------------

Most OAD settings are defined in ``oad_client.c`` and ``oad_config.h``, and already 
discussed in :ref:`sec-oad-pause-and-resume`. In addition to this you can override the
``OAD_BLOCK_SIZE`` from the default of 128 by defining it in the project options.
Setting this higher than 128 is not advised as this is the setting used during
system testing.

Beacon Mode, Non Beacon Mode and Frequency Hopping network modes are supported.
In Non Beacon Mode and Frequency Hopping the default OAD parameters are::

    #define OAD_BLOCK_REQ_RATE            200
    #define OAD_BLOCK_REQ_POLL_DELAY      50
    #define OAD_MAX_TIMEOUTS              3
    #define OAD_MAX_RETRIES               3
    #define OAD_BLOCK_AUTO_RESUME_DELAY   5000

Under normal conditions the sensor sends a block request every 200ms, with a
typical file of 920 blocks this takes ~3 minutes. In Beacon Mode only one data
request can be sent during 1 beacon interval. The default OAD settings are::


    #define BEACON_INTERVAL             ((((0x01) << (CONFIG_MAC_BEACON_ORDER)) * \
                                          (SYMBOL_DURATION) * (BASE_SUPER_FRAME_DURATION)) / (1000)) // ms
    #define OAD_BLOCK_REQ_RATE            ((BEACON_INTERVAL) - 100)
    #define OAD_BLOCK_REQ_POLL_DELAY      ((BEACON_INTERVAL) - 400)
    #define OAD_MAX_TIMEOUTS              3
    #define OAD_MAX_RETRIES               3
    #define OAD_BLOCK_AUTO_RESUME_DELAY   (CONFIG_MAC_SUPERFRAME_ORDER * 5)

Under normal conditions the OAD will take CONFIG_SUPERFRAME_ORDER * 920 seconds.

The ``sensor_oad`` project has 2 defines related to the OAD feature, defined by
default in the Application/Defines/sensor_oad .opts file:

-   ``FEATURE_BLE_OAD`` This includes the OAD linker command file and OAD |TIRTOS| 
    config file that supports updates through BLE.

-   ``FEATURE_NATIVE_OAD`` This includes the TI 15.4-Stack OAD client. This
    results in an application that supports the OAD messages needed to receive
    an OAD update over the TI 15.4-Stack network.

Removing the ``FEATURE_NATIVE_OAD`` symbol will result in an application that is
capable of being updated through a BLE link only. For a TI 15.4-Stack OAD both
``FEATURE_BLE_OAD`` and ``FEATURE_NATIVE_OAD`` should be defined.
