Creating Custom Applications
============================

|TIMAC| based system designers must have a firm grasp on the general system
architecture, application, and |TIMAC| framework to implement a custom
application. This section provides indications on where and how to start writing
a custom application, and to decide which role and purpose the custom
application should have. If an application is to start the network and be the
central node in the network, begin with the Collector Example Application. If
the application is to join the network and be a node in the network that
communicates with the central node, begin with the Sensor Example Application.

Adding a Board File
-------------------

After selecting the reference application and preprocessor symbol, add a board
file that matches the custom board layout. The following steps provide guidance
on adding a custom board file to the project.

#.  Create a custom board file (TI recommends using the Launchpad module board
    file included in the example applications as a starting reference).

#.  Modify the PIN structure.

#.  Add peripheral driver initialization objects, according to the board
    design.

#.  Include files from the folder of the start-up application.

#.  Add the custom board file to the application project.

#.  Update the C compiler search path of the IDE to point to the header file
    of the new board file.

#.  Define an identifier for the new board file.

#.  Rebuild the application project.

.. _sec-configuring-parameters-for-custom-hardware:

Configuring Parameters for Custom Hardware
------------------------------------------

#.  Set the parameters, such as the sleep clock accuracy of the 32.768-kHz
    crystal.

#.  Define the :term:`CCFG` parameters.

.. note:: For a description of the CCFG configuration parameters, see the |TRM|.

.. _sec-creating-additional-tasks:

Creating Additional Tasks
-------------------------

Many implementations can use the |RTOS| environment to operate in the
application task framework. However, if the system design requires an additional
|RTOS| task, see :ref:`sec-rtos-overview-initializing-a-task` for guidance on
adding a task.

.. _sec-configuring-ti154stack:

Configuring TI 15.4-MAC Stack
-----------------------------

Configure |TIMAC| with parameters and features. :ref:`chap-ti154stack-overview`
describes the operation and configuration parameters for the stack
project for beacon-mode, nonbeacon mode, and the frequency-hopping configuration
mode of the network.
