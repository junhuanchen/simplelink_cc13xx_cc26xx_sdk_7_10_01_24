Over-the-Air Download (OAD)
###########################

The following sections aim to describe the lower layers of OAD software that are
common across all protocol stack implementations. This includes the OAD image
header, the flash layout, Boot Image Manager, and the oad\_image\_tool.

.. warning::

    The |STACK| OAD does not implement or perform any security or
    authentication mechanisms as part of the firmware update process.
    System developers should take measures to adequately authenticate peer
    devices and only accept and/or apply firmware images transferred from
    trusted sources via OAD. 

    When using the Secure OAD feature along with recommended parameters,
    firmware images are authenticated on the device using ECDSA signature
    validation algorithms to ensure image authenticity prior to updating the
    running firmware image.
