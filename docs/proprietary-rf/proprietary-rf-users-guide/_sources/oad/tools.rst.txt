OAD Image Tool
==============

The OAD image tool is a script written in python that is intended to process
the compiler output in the form of a hex file and prepare the image for over the
air transfer.

The major components of the oad\_image\_tool include:

    - Conversion from \*.hex to \*.bin

    - Padding the image to be word aligned

    - Calculating the CRC and embedding it in the image header

    - Optional: Merging a split image into a single app + stack image

The tool is located in the ``tools/common/oad`` folder of the |SDK|.


Running the tool
----------------

The OAD Image Tool is distributed in both source and binary form. The correct
binary will be bundled with the installer for a given platform (i.e. Linux,
Windows, Mac). However, the tool can also be run in source if desired.

The tool is intended to run as a post build step to an OAD application.  When
run as a post build step, the tool will generate an output binary file named
``<app_name>_oad.bin`` where ``<app_name>`` is the name and path specified by
the required ``-o`` argument to the script.

It is recommended to use the OAD enabled example application from the intended
protocol stack component of the |SDK| and copy + modify the post build step as
needed.


Running the Tool from Source
----------------------------

In general, it is recommended to invoke the tool via the binaries distributed
with the |SDK|. However if it is required to run the tool is source, the
following steps should be taken:

    - Ensure Python 2.7.1 is installed on the system

    - Install the required packages via pip (see `requirements.txt` and
      `README.html` in the same folder as the tool)


Required Arguments/Getting help
-------------------------------

If help is needed when running the tool, invoke it with the ``-h`` option which
will describe the supported features of the tool, the arguments and the actions
they perform.
