Operation Modes
---------------

The following is a broad description of the operation modes supported on the
|DEVICEAND| devices. A more detailed description is given in the |TRM|. You
can also find more specific information by using `SysConfig`_ or `SmartRF
Studio`_. Here you will also find settings for all supported modes for the
different frequency bands.

.. note::

    Not all modes and frequency bands are supported on all devices. Please see
    the |DATASHEET| for more information.

:Generic GFSK Mode:
    Recommended operation mode.  Uses a binary
    :wikipedia:`Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK)<Frequency-shift_keying#Gaussian_frequency-shift_keying>`
    modulation scheme. No Manchester encoding (1 |_| Bit |_| = |_| 1 |_| Symbol).

:Simplelink Long Range (SLRM):
    Uses a 2-GFSK modulation scheme. Recommended for applications requiring long range.

:Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):
    The Bluetooth Low Energy physical layers use a GFSK modulation scheme.

:On-off Keying (OOK):
    Uses amplitude-shift keying modulation scheme (presence or not of a carrier).

:Long-Range Mode (LRM):
    Uses :wikipedia:`Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)<Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum>`.

:IEEE 802.15.4 Mode:
    The IEEE 802.15.4 physical layers use a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation scheme.

:High Speed Mode:
    For supported devices, you can see an example implementation of the High
    Speed mode (HS mode) in the RF Packet Error Rate test example project.
