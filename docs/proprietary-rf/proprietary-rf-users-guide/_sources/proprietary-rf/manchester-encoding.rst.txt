Manchester Encoding
===================

Many legacy protocols use manchester encoding to increase robustness. This is
not needed on modern devices like the |DEVICEAND| and **we do not recommend
using manchester encoding**. Manchester encoding consumes half the channel
bandwidth and reduces spectral efficiency. Instead, the |DEVICEAND| offers a
powerful sync word correlator. It also provides whitening in order to improve
the spectral efficiency.

The |DEVICEAND| supports manchester encoding of the payload and the CRC only.
Since the sync word is not encoded, it must be done manually which limits the
effective length to 16 bits.

Manchester encoding of the preamble is only possible via an additional
override::

    // Set new preamble pattern 1100110011001100 (0xCCCC)
    (uint32_t)0xCCCC0043,

The pattern length is limited to 16 bits and will be repeated afterwards,
depending on the configured preamble length in the setup command.

  - Enable manchester coding by changing the MCE_RF_OVERRIDE to MCE_RFE_OVERRIDE(0,5,0,1,0,0) and setting PROP_RADIO_DIV_SETUP.formatConf.fecMode = 0xA
  - The following override has to be added to get the bytes in the correct order:  HW_REG_OVERRIDE(0x52B4,0x270C)

 .. only:: sdk_targets_cc13xx_cc26xx
 
  - Enable manchester coding by setting PROP_RADIO_DIV_SETUP.formatConf.fecMode = 0xA 
  - The following override has to be added:  HW_REG_OVERRIDE(0x5320, 0x1000)
  
    Manchester coding has only been functionally verified on |PROPRFDEVICE|.

The strict sync word check in |PROPRFDEVICE| is not in use when using manchester
coding. To reduce the number of false syncs the sync threshold could be
increased.

.. only:: sdk_targets_cc13x0
     
  The sync word threshold could be set with the following override::
	 
       HW_REG_OVERRIDE(0x5104,0xYYZZ)

.. only:: sdk_targets_cc13xx_cc26xx

  The sync word threshold could be set with the following override:: 
	 
	   HW_REG_OVERRIDE(0x5114,0xYYZZ)
   
where YY and ZZ is the threshold for the two correlators. For simplicity the two
thresholds can be set equal. Higher value is stricter.
