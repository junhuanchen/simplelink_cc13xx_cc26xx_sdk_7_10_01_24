Physical Layer (PHY)
======================

The radio in the CC13xx and CC26xx device platform offers a wide variety of 
different operational modes, covering many different packet formats. The radio 
firmware executes from the CC13x2 and CC26x2 platform radio domain on an 
Arm® Cortex®-M0 processor, which can provide extensive baseband automation. 
The application software interfaces and interoperates with the radio firmware 
using shared memory interface (system RAM or radio RAM) and specific handshake 
hardware (radio doorbell).

In this section we will explore the main type of radio PHY configuration used 
to create proprietary network/protocols.
