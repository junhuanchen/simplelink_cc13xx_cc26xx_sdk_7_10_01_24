.. warning::

    The BLE-Stack OAD Profile does not implement or perform any security or
    authentication mechanisms as part of the firmware update process.
    System developers should take measures to adequately authenticate peer
    devices and only accept and/or apply firmware images transferred from
    trusted sources via the OAD Profile. TI recommends applications use
    Bluetooth LE Secure Connections (LESC) with Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
    protection with peer devices when performing wireless firmware updates,
    although the use of the LESC feature does not itself guarantee image
    authenticity.
