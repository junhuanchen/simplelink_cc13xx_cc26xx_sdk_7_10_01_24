Proprietary Mode
================

The proprietary physical layer (PHY) is the most common physical layer for
Sub-1 GHz radio communication, but is also supported on 2.4 GHz. It is
available on the CC13x0, CC13x2, CC26x2, and CC2640R2 devices. The CC1310 and
CC1312 devices supports only Sub-1 GHz while the CC2640R2, CC2650, and CC26x2
devices can only operate at 2.4 GHz. The CC1350 and CC1352 devices can operate
in both frequency bands.

`SmartRF Studio`_ is TI's tool for evaluating proprietary RF physical layers
without  having to write any code. In SmartRF Studio, you can easily evaluate
different PHYs. You will also find characterized settings for all supported
modes of operation for each individual device.

For CC13x0, CC2650, and CC2640R2, when you have used `SmartRF Studio`_ to find your 
preferred PHY, you can export the RF driver settings (``smartrf_settings.c/h``) 
into your software project. Step-by-step instructions for doing this is found 
in `Simplelink Academy`_.

For CC13x2 and CC26x2, you can use SysConfig to implement the settings you
tested with SmartRF Studio, see :ref:`Adding RF Settings
<sysconfig-radio-configuration>` for more details.
