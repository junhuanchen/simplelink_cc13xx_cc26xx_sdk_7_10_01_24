High Speed (HS) Mode
====================

This section describes how to configure the High Speed physical layer. 
The High Speed PHY supports the following coding and modulation format:

* 2(G)FSK

* 4(G)FSK

* Manchester encoding/decoding

and it is designed so it is flexible when it comes to make test cases with different combination of:

* Symbol rate

* Frequency deviation

* Channel bandwidth

The High Speed PHY is flexible, but as for all PHY, this PHY has limitations too. One important limitation 
is that the maximum symbol rate is 2 Mbaud. The maximum symbol rate for enabling bit true checking is 1 Mbaud.

There is almost no minimum symbol rate, but frequency tolerance requirement set by the system will set the 
minimum symbol rate. The High Speed PHY and GenFSK PHY has the same minimum symbol rate.
