RF Core
=======

The RF Core is the radio peripheral of the |DEVICEAND| family. It is a
software configurable, high-performance transceiver that can handle multiple
protocol standards. It operates autonomously from the main CPU and is
controlled via various commands. Both RF core and CPU are connected by set of
»doorbell« registers, interrupt signals and shared memory.

This chapter describes the usage of the RF core and its features from a
software developer's perspective.  It provides a more high-level view than the
|TRM|.
