Radio operation commands
========================

Radio operation commands are more complex than direct and immediate commands
and their execution can take much longer time. In order to understand the
whole process, it may help to think of the RF core as a washing machine and
the radio operation commands as washing programs. The command parameters
represent all the knobs and buttons that modify the chosen program.
