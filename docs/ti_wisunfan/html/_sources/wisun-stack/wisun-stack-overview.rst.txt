Overview
--------

Wi-SUN is a wireless communication standard aiming to enable large-scale IOT
networks in a mesh structure. The network typically consists of line powered
routers and gateways, and battery powered end nodes. The |SPEC| is given by the
`Wi-SUN Alliance`_.

In |STACK|, the 6LoWPAN, RPL, IPv6, ICMPv6 and UDP layers have been adapted from
open source components. An overview of the SW components is given in 
:numref:`fig-wisun-block-diagram`

    TI Wi-SUN FAN Stack Overview
    

What is a FAN?
--------------

FAN - field area network is a network type aiming for connectivity on a larger
scale. Example uses are within a smart city. To achieve this, the FAN consists
of multiple smaller personal area networks (PANs). The FAN can connect to a Wide
area network (WAN) in order to grow the scale even more.

Within each PAN, nodes assume one of three operational roles (set via the local
administrative policy):

- Each PAN contains a **Border Router** providing WAN connectivity to the PAN.
  The Border Router maintains source routing tables for all nodes within its PAN,
  provides node authentication and key management services, and disseminates PAN
  wide information such as broadcast schedules.
- **Router node**, which provides upward and downward packet forwarding (within
  a PAN). A Router also provides services for relaying security and address
  management protocols.
- **Leaf nodes** provide minimum capabilities: discovering and joining a PAN,
  send/receive IPv6 packets, etc. (Leaf node role is not implemented in TI Wi-SUN
  FAN.)

The node roles and network leves are visualized in :numref:`fig-pan-fan`

Architecture Choices
--------------------

|STACK| can be used in two separate architectures based on the end product
application. :numref:`fig-wisun-device-configuration` shows the two different
system architectures enabled by |STACK|.

    NWP and Embedded Configurations

-   A co-processor is shown in :numref:`fig-wisun-device-configuration` (left). The
    protocol stack runs on the device while the application is executed on an
    external MPU or MCU. The application interfaces with the device using the
    network protocol interface (NWP) over a serial universal asynchronous
    receiver/transmitter (UART) connection. This configuration is useful for
    cases where the application image is large. If the application is run from a
    host device, it will not be limited by the flash size of the device. The NWP
    interface is documented in the :ref:`chap-wisun-NWP-guide`.

-   A single device is shown in :numref:`fig-wisun-device-configuration` (right).
    The application and protocol stack are both implemented on the embedded device
    as a true single-chip solution.This configuration is the simplest and most
    common for network nodes.

Please see the :ref:`sec-wisun-examples` for availability of the modes on
specific part numbers.
