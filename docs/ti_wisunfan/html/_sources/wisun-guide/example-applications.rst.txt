Example Application Guide
=========================

This section provides an overview of the |STACK| out-of-box example applications
and instructions on how to run them.

The Wi-SUN FAN mesh network consists of two types of logical devices:

* The border router device
* Router node devices.

This separation of the device types derives from the |SPEC|. The |STACK| can be
configured in either of the two roles by choosing the corresponding application.

The example applications provided in the |STACK| are developed for the |PROPRFDEVICE|
platform. The examples can be run in two modes:

* Embedded mode, where the full Wi-SUN Stack and application run on the |PROPRFDEVICE|
  device.
* NWP mode, where the |PROPRFDEVICE| device acts as a network processor. In this case,
  you will need a host device, e.g. a laptop.

You can read more about these two modes in the chapter :ref:`sec-wisun-architecture`.

For each example you will find two variants:

* The ``_src`` variant, which exposes all open source code.
* The non-src variant, which uses libraries as much as possible.

The advantage to using the ``_src`` example projects can be to learn about the
TI Wi-SUN FAN stack. It can simplify debugging.

The advantage to using the non-src variant is that this uses prebuilt libraries.
This means that the build time is as low as possible.


.. _sec-wisun-coap-application:

Router Node Embedded Mode Example Application (ns_coap_node)
------------------------------------------------------------

A router node (RN) is a device capable of connecting to other devices in the mesh
network. It can provide upward and downward packet forwarding. A new device is
able to join the network through any router. The connections between different
router nodes form the mesh topology. The ``ns_coap_node`` example implements the
router node with embedded mode architecture. **This is the recommended example
to use as a starting point for router node development.**

The ``ns_coap_node`` example is a fully embedded application demonstrating a
CoAP server on Wi-SUN FAN stack. The example is intended to work with the border
router example, which acts as the CoAP client that interacts via the CoAP
protocol with the CoAP node server. CoAP is an abbreviation of COnstrained
Application Protocol.

Running the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For information on how to run the router node example application please see the
``README.md`` included with the application source code.

Device support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``ns_coap_node`` is supported on the following development boards:

- CC1312R7 LaunchPad
- CC1352P7-1 LaunchPad

.. _sec-wisun-coap-oad-application:

Router Node Embedded Mode Example Application with OAD (ns_coap_oad)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The ``ns_coap_oad`` example is an extension of ``ns_coap_node`` example.
In addition to the coap server for the LED resource, the application also has OAD capabilities.
The CC1312R7 and CC1352P7-1 Launchpads support off chip oad. But the 13x4 series supports both on-chip
and off-chip OAD examples.

Running the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For information on how to run the application please see the
``README.md`` included with the application source code.

Device support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``ns_coap_node`` is supported on the following development boards:

- CC1312R7 LaunchPad
- CC1352P7-1 LaunchPad
- CC1314R10 Launchpad
- CC1354P10 Launchpad

Router Node NWP Mode Example Application (ns_node)
--------------------------------------------------

A router node (RN) is a device capable of connecting to other devices in the mesh
network. It can provide upward and downward packet forwarding. A new device is
able to join the network through any router. The connections between different
router nodes form the mesh topology. The ``ns_node`` example implements the
router node with NWP mode architecture. Please note, in most situations it makes
sense to run the router node in embedded mode. For an example of this, please
refer to the :ref:`sec-wisun-coap-application`.

Running the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For information on how to run the router node example application please see the
``README.md`` included with the application source code.

Device support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``ns_node`` is supported on the following development boards:

- CC1312R1 LaunchPad
- CC1352P-1 LaunchPad
- CC1352R1 LaunchPad
- CC1312R7 LaunchPad
- CC1352P7-1 LaunchPad


Border Router Example Application (ns_br)
-----------------------------------------

A border router (BR) device is a router that can also act as gateway between the
Wi-SUN FAN and a different network. In addition, the border router acts as the
:term:`root` device and establishes the network. For this reason, a Wi-SUN FAN
needs at least one BR. The ``ns_br`` example implements the border router with
NWP mode architecture.

Running the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For information on how to run the border router example application please see the
``README.md`` included with the application source code.

Device support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``ns_br`` is supported on the following development boards:

- CC1312R7 LaunchPad
- CC1352P7-1 LaunchPad

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Example configuration is done mainly through SysConfig. You can read about
SysConfig configuration in :ref:`chap-wisun-sysconfig`.

For NWP mode, many values can be set at run time through the NWP interface. Please
see the NWP interface guide or ti-wisunfan py-spinel readme for details.
