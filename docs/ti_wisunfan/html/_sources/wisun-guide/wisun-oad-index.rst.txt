MCUBoot Over-the-Air Download (OAD)
###################################

The following sections aim to describe the lower layers of OAD software that are
common across all protocol stack implementations. This includes the OAD image
header, the flash layout, Secure Bootloader, and the oad image tool.

.. warning::

    The |STACK| OAD Profile does not implement or perform any security or
    authentication mechanisms as part of the firmware update process.
    System developers should take measures to adequately authenticate peer
    devices and only accept and/or apply firmware images transferred from
    trusted sources via the OAD Profile.

.. attention::

    Due to memory constraints, the |STACK| does not support on-chip OAD on CC13x2 or CC13x2x7 devices.

The following sections aim to describe the |STACK| specific application and
profile layer of the OAD solution. The OAD application section will describe
the |STACK| process from a high level in terms of events and states, and the
profile section will cover the actual structures that are sent over the air.
