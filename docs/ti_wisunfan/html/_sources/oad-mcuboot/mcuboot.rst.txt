MCUboot Overview
================

MCUboot is an open source project that supports hardware-independent secure
bootloader for 32-bit MCUs. In the context of OAD, MCUboot serves the same
purpose as the :term:`BIM`, which is to verify and boot into the new image once
downloaded.

Implementation details can be found in the public
`MCUboot documentation <https://docs.mcuboot.com/>`_. The code is maintained on
the `MCUboot GitHub page <https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot>`_.

.. note:: The MCUboot Project seeks to produce, develop and maintain an
          open-source reference secure bootloader for microcontroller-based
          systems.
