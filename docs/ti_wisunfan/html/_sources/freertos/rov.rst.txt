Debugging FreeRTOS with Runtime Object View (ROV)
=================================================
One of the kernel tools available for debugging FreeRTOS is the Runtime Object View (ROV) in CCS.
Users can view the FreeRTOS kernel using ROV by navigating to Tools-> Runtime Object View. 

More detailed information about the ROV is found in the 
`ROV FAQ <https://e2e.ti.com/support/processors-group/processors/f/processors-forum/859586/faq-what-is-the-rov-runtime-object-viewer/3179297#3179297>`_. 
Two subtleties about 
using ROV with FreeRTOS are that:

#. The SDK does not provide a way for users to name pthreads on top of FreeRTOS
#. For POSIX based examples, an 'x' is used for the underlying FreeRTOS task name

CCS supports Eclipse-based plug-ins to aid in FreeRTOS debugging. One example is the High Integrity Systems 
`Stateviewer software. <https://www.highintegritysystems.com/down-loads/stateviewer-plug-in/>`_
