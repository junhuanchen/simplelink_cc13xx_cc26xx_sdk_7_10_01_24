Running Software Examples on the |DEVICE1M|
===========================================

Software Examples for the |DEVICE1M|
------------------------------------

It is not currently possible to use the
:ref:`sec-sysconfig-migrate-device` tool to change the device types of 
projects using |DEVICE1| to |DEVICE1M|.  Developers are strongly encouraged 
to import a project which contains the correct settings for their target 
device and port the stack application accordingly. Example projects can be found
in the following location:

<SDK_DIR>\\examples\\rtos\\<LaunchPad variant>\\<stack>\\<application>\\tirtos\\<ticlang/iar>

For LP-EM-CC1314R10, LP-EM-CC1354P10-1 and LP-EM-CC1354P10-6, software examples
are provided in the |SDK|. 

If your product will use CC1354R10, CC2674R10 or CC2674P10, the recommendation
is to start with a LP-EM-CC1354P10 software example.

Migrate Your CC13x2 or CC26x2 Project
-------------------------------------

This section will describe a way to migrate an existing project to the CC13x4 or
CC26x4 device.

The best way to migrate is to open a new project from the new SDK and transfer 
your changes and application code over to the new example. 

#. Choose the CC13x4 SDK example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality or corresponds to your existing project.

#. Transfer the SysConfig settings. You can do this through the GUI, or open
   both the old and the new project ``.syscfg`` files in a text comparison
   program and copy-paste the desired settings.

#. Transfer all modified application files from your existing project into the
   CC13x4 example project. If applicable: delete application files that are not
   used from the CC13x4 example project.

You can find instructions on how to design and configure a custom board in the 
:ref:`sec-custom-hardware` chapter.

Specific Software Changes from CC13x2 and CC26x2 Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your project has not been updated to the latest SDK, you may run into one or
more of the following limitations:

Memory
""""""
The |DEVICE1M| devices contain 1M (1024KB) internal flash and 256KB RAM. 

ROM
"""
On |DEVICE1M| devices, there is no RTOS or connectivity stack in ROM. Instead,
the RTOS and stacks are stored in flash. There are no required software changes.

PIN and GPIO Drivers
""""""""""""""""""""
Legacy PIN drivers are not supported on |DEVICE1M| devices. Instead you should
use the GPIO++ driver. For more information about GPIO++ driver, refer to the
migration guide :ref:`sec-cc13xx-cc26xx-gpio++-porting-guide`

UART Driver
"""""""""""
The legacy UART driver is not supported. Instead use the new UART2 driver. 
More information available in the :ref:`uart_to_uart2-porting-guide`. 

RTOS
""""
|DEVICE1M| devices will only support TI-RTOS7 and FreeRTOS, not legacy TI-RTOS
(also called RTOS6 or BIOS6). More information about TI-RTOS7 is available here:
:ref:`tirtos_to_tirtos7-porting-guide`.

GCC
"""
GCC compiler is not supported with |DEVICE1M|. Instead, customers should use the
TI-CLANG or IAR compiler.
