Ubiqua Protocol Analyzer
------------------------

Install the Required Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download and install the following software:

* `Ubiqua Protocol Analyzer`_ software

* `SmartRF Protocol Packet Sniffer`_, which contains sniffer firmware for the
  |UBIQUA_SNIFFER|

* `Flash Programmer`_, used to program the |UBIQUA_SNIFFER|

.. note::

    Download SmartRF Protocol Packet Sniffer and SmartRF Flash Programmer,
    **not** SmartRF Packet Sniffer 2 and SmartRF Flash Programmer 2.


Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended to use the |UBIQUA_DEVICE| with `Ubiqua Protocol Analyzer`_.
The device comes pre-programmed with the packet sniffer firmware. However, if
it is not programmed with the sniffer firmware, the |CC_DEBUGGER| is required
to flash the device.

The Cebal driver must be installed to use the |CC_DEBUGGER|. The driver should
already be installed if you have installed `Flash Programmer`_. This can be
verified by connecting a device to the debugger, opening up `Flash
Programmer`_, and observing the device showing up as connected.

`Ubiqua Protocol Analyzer`_ also provides the necessary files for installing the Cebal driver.
The installation files are found under ``C:\Program Files
(x86)\Ubilogix\Drivers\TI\``, with ``cebal2.*`` files for 32-bit Windows and
``cebal2_x64.*`` files for 64-bit Windows. Depending on which Windows version
you are using, refer to a corresponding guide for how to install Windows
drivers.


Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Connect the |UBIQUA_DEVICE| to the computer with Ubiqua installed.

* If the device is not programmed with the sniffer firmware, connect a
  |CC_DEBUGGER| to it and use `Flash Programmer`_ to program the sniffer
  firmware.

    * The firmware image for |UBIQUA_SNIFFER| is called
      ``sniffer_fw_cc2531.hex``, and is found under ``bin/general/firmware``
      in the `SmartRF Protocol Packet Sniffer`_ installation.

    * Refer to the |CC_DEBUGGER_UG| for how to flash the firmware.
