Debug Serial Back Channel Connection
====================================

A secondary serial debug connection exists in the |STACK| examples. This
section will describe the physical connections needed to take advantage of
the default pin mapping for this back channel.

.. note::
    The LaunchPad VDD-IO is 3.3V, not 5V, be careful with your connections.

Multiple flying lead USB-to-Serial adaptors exist, such as:

* `FTDI TTL-232R-RPI <http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_RPi.pdf>`_
* `USB to TTL Serial Cable <https://www.adafruit.com/product/954>`_

Fixed header USB-to-Serial can also be used with jumper wires, like:

* `FTDI TTL-232R-3V3 <http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf>`_

Or the UART back-channel on a second LaunchPad could be used by jumpering
the TXD and RXD headers.

An example setup with the USB to TTL Serial Cable can be seen in
:numref:`thread-debug-uart-connections`

    USB to TTL Serial Cable connections to the |LP|

The default routing for the |LP| are connections are board TX is ``DIO18``
and board RX is ``DIO19``. The corresponding connections for the USB to TTL
Serial Cable are as follows:

+-------+-------------------+------------+
| Color | Connection        | Pin        |
+=======+===================+============+
| Green | Transmit from USB | ``DIO19``  |
+-------+-------------------+------------+
| White | Receive from USB  | ``DIO18``  |
+-------+-------------------+------------+
| Black | Ground            | ``GND``    |
+-------+-------------------+------------+
| Red   | VCC               | No Connect |
+-------+-------------------+------------+

.. warning::
    Consult the datasheet for your USB-to-Serial connection before powering
    the device.
