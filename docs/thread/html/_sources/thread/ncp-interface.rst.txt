NCP Interface
=============

The OpenThread stack runs on the |DEVICE| while the application is executed on
a separate external host processor. The host processor communicates with the
NCP device via a serial interface, such as UART or SPI, using the `Spinel
Protocol`_.


.. _sec-tiop-ncp-spinel:

Spinel Protocol
---------------

Spinel is a general management protocol for enabling a host device to
communicate with and manage an NCP. For more information, see the
Internet-Draft for the `Spinel Protocol`_.

This protocol is included with the OpenThread NCP library
``libopenthread_ncp_ncp_<platform>``, and source code found at ``/src/ncp``. A
Python CLI tool called Pyspinel is available for testing purposes. For more
information, see the `Pyspinel GitHub repository`_.


.. _sec-tiop-ncp-wpantund:

wpantund
--------

``wpantund`` is a user-space network interface driver/daemon that provides a
native IPv6 network interface to an NCP. It was written and developed by Nest
Labs to better support Thread connectivity on Unix-like operating systems. It
uses Spinel to communicate with an NCP.

``wpantund`` is not included with OpenThread. For more information, see the
`wpantund GitHub repository`_.


.. _sec-tiop-ncp-serial-interface:

Serial Interface Configuration
------------------------------

TI-OpenThread supports Spinel to be configured over both UART and SPI. By
default, the TI-OpenThread NCP example is configured for UART. but can be
configured by SPI with the following changes:

- In the Device configuration under ``libopenthread_ncp_<platform>``, change
  enable and disable the following:

    - Set ``OPENTHREAD_ENABLE_NCP_UART`` to 0
    - Set ``OPENTHREAD_ENABLE_NCP_SPI`` to 1

The device uses the SPI1 peripheral for the Spinel interface, and assigns the
following PINs for SPI1:

=============  ==========
PIN            DIO
=============  ==========
``SPI1_MISO``  ``DIO 24``
``SPI1_MOSI``  ``DIO 25``
``SPI1_CLK``   ``DIO 26``
``SPI1_CSN``   ``DIO 27``
=============  ==========
