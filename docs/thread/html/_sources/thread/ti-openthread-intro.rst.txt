The |SDK| is part of TI's SimpleLink MCU platform which offers a single
development environment that delivers flexible hardware, software and tool
options for customers developing wired and wireless applications. Visit the
`SimpleLink MCU Platform homepage <http://www.ti.com/simplelink>`_ for more
information about the SimpleLink ecosystem.

Thread is an IP-Based mesh networking protocol that runs on :term:`IEEE`
802.15.4 radios. Thread was designed with one goal in mind: "*To create the
best way to connect and control products in the home*". For information, see
`Thread Group Homepage`_.

OpenThread is an open source implementation of the Thread specification, which
includes all Thread networking layers and device roles, as well as Border
Router support. For more information, see `OpenThread Homepage`_.

TI-OpenThread is part of the |SDK|, which contains the supported software for
the |DEVICE|. The TI-OpenThread stack integrates the OpenThread stack with the
SimpleLink ecosystem. Besides supporting all the OpenThread features, the
TI-OpenThread stack has the added benefit of running on top of |TIRTOS| which
inherently adds support for SimpleLink development boards and the SimpleLink
development environment. For more information about the TI-OpenThread stack
implementation, see Section :ref:`sec-tiop-overview`.

    Do not use this document as a substitute for the complete Thread protocol
    specification. For more details, refer to the `OpenThread Homepage`_ or
    the Thread specification from the `Thread Group Homepage`_.
