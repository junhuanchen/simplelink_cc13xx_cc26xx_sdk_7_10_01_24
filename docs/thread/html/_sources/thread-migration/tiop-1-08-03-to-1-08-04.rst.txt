TI-OpenThread 1.08.03 to 1.08.04
--------------------------------

For the 5.20 SDK, the openthread libraries (e.g. libopenthread*) have been
unified across the CC13xx/CC26xx platform. Recall that in previous SDKs, the
libraries had different configurations for a specific board
(e.g. libopenthread_mtd_CC1352P_2, libopenthread_mtd_CC26X2R1).

    Separate Libs Per Board

The examples would use the lib* projects corresponding to the matching board.
Now, Thread examples will use the same libraries. One benefit of this is that,
if you have two instances of the same Thread example (e.g. doorlock) in a
workspace, and each instance was using a different board (e.g. CC26x2R1 and
CC1352R1), then there will now be one, shared MTD library,
libopenthread_mtd_cc13x2_cc26x2 vs two, libopenthread_mtd_CC26X2R1 and
libopenthread_mtd_CC1352R1. More generally, Thread examples in a workspace will
now share libraries across different Thread-enabled SimpleLink devices when
possible.

    Unified Libs For All Boards

For migrating your Thread project to use the unified libraries:

#. Import the respective libraries necessary for your project.
   These can be found in :code:`C:\ti\<5.20 SDK>\source\ti\thread\cc13x2_26x2`.
   As an example, the following libraries were imported for :code:`cli_ftd`:

        Unified Libs

#.  Update the library paths that your project points to.
    Right-click the project |rarr| Properties |rarr| Build |rarr| Dependencies.

    Remove the previous libraries:

        Old Libraries

    Add the unified libraries:

        New Libraries

    Make sure that the order is the same as before. This is to account for
    include paths to the referenced projects.

        Order the Reference Projects

#.  Change the name of config files, since these now match the unified naming
    convention.
    If you made any configuration changes to these files, you should now apply
    those changes to the new config files.

        New Config File Names

#.  Re-build your Thread project. This will prompt CCS to build the new
    libraries.
