TI-OpenThread 1.07.00 to 1.08.00
--------------------------------

In this guide we will take the doorlock example application from the 
TI-OpenThread Stack version ``1.07.00`` (4.10 SDK) to work with the
TI-OpenThread Stack version ``1.08.00`` (4.20 SDK). The doorlock is a
:term:`MTD` example, the migration will be very similar for :term:`FTD`
projects. I am showing off migrating a ti-cgt toolchain example (ccs).


.. warning::

    The door_lock example was chosen for its simple nature, and because it
    shows off the issues we faced porting from the previous stack to this one.
    This guide is by no means exhaustive, your application may use different
    APIs or expect different behavior.


Switch Project to New SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the instructions :ref:`here <change-the-selected-product>` to make
the current project use the new SDK.

We will resolve issues specific to this migration below.


Updated OpenThread Functions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We need to change the function :code:`otPlatDiagProcess` (in doorlock.c):

.. code-block:: diff

   -void otPlatDiagProcess(otInstance *aInstance, int argc, char *argv[],
   +otError otPlatDiagProcess(otInstance *aInstance, uint8_t argc, char *argv[],
                       char *aOutput, size_t aOutputMaxLen)
    {
       ...
   +    return retval;
    }


Change Library Include Paths
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Due to new build location for libraries (e.g. libmbedcrypto*, libopenthread*),
we need to modify the search paths for them:
Right-click project |rarr| Properties |rarr| Build |rarr| ARM Linker |rarr| File
Search Path. In the library search path section, change the following:

.. code-block:: none

    ${REF_PROJECT_1_LOC}/Debug
    ${REF_PROJECT_2_LOC}/Debug
    ${REF_PROJECT_3_LOC}/Debug

to

.. code-block:: none

    ${REF_PROJECT_1_LOC}/OptimizeSize
    ${REF_PROJECT_2_LOC}/OptimizeSize
    ${REF_PROJECT_3_LOC}/OptimizeSize

.. _fig-lib-include-paths:
.. figure:: resources/1-07-00-to-1-08-00/fig-lib-include-paths.png
    :align: center

    Update include paths
