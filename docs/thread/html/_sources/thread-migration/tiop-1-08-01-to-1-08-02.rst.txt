TI-OpenThread 1.08.01 to 1.08.02
--------------------------------

For the 4.40 SDK, the openthread libraries (e.g. libopenthread*) have been
unified across the CC13x2/CC26x2 platform. Recall that in previous SDKs, the libraries had
different configurations for a specific board
(e.g. libopenthread_mtd_CC1352P_2, libopenthread_mtd_CC26X2R1).

    Separate Libs Per Board

The examples would use the lib* projects corresponding to the matching board.
Now, Thread examples will use the same libraries. One benefit of this is that, if you have
two instances of the same Thread example (e.g. doorlock) in a workspace, and
each instance was using a different board (e.g. CC26x2R1 and CC1352R1),
then there will now be one, shared MTD library, libopenthread_mtd_cc13x2_cc26x2 vs
two, libopenthread_mtd_CC26X2R1 and libopenthread_mtd_CC1352R1. More generally, Thread examples in a workspace will now share libraries across different Thread-enabled SimpleLink devices when possible.

    Unified Libs For All Boards

By default, the 4.40 examples will import the unified libraries, but the 4.40
SDK will still keep the previous library projects available for migration
purposes. Future SDKs will tend toward the unified approach.
The projects for the unified libraries are located here:

	- :code:`C:\ti\<4.40 SDK>\source\ti\thread\cc13x2_26x2`

The board-specific libraries are found here:
	
	- :code:`C:\ti\<4.40 SDK>\source\ti\thread\rtos`
