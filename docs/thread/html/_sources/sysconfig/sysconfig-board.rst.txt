Configure The Board Files with SysConfig
----------------------------------------

The board view shows you what pins are available on your board, and what
peripherals are assigned to what pins. Hover over each pin for more information.

Enabled and configured peripherals are displayed with a green symbols. To add a
new peripheral, press the plus sign next to the peripheral type. The "Show
generated files" tab lets you see the files generated based on SysConfig.
Generated files are dynamically updated every time you make a change in
SysConfig. When you build your project, the generated files are exported into the
output folder of your project.

.. _sysconfig-reserve-peripherals:

Reserve Peripheral(s)
---------------------

Certain use cases may require preventing SysConfig from generating
the configurationof specific peripherals.

Examples of use cases requiring to reserve peripherals are:

* dynamic re-configuration of a peripheral
* leveraging the Sensor Controller (on devices enabling it)
* already handling certain peripherals configuration
* with hardware constraints preventing to use certain peripherals 
  (typically GPIOs)
* peripherals reserved for future use

Below are the steps required to utilize the Reserve Peripherals feature.

1. Open the ``.syscfg`` file using the SysConfig GUI

2. Open the panel "Reserve Peripherals"

3. Reserve the resources

      Reserve a peripheral using SysConfig. This image shows how to reserve DIO 15.

SysConfig ensures no resource conflict occurs. In case no solution
can be found, an error is raised.

Hardware View
-------------

The Hardware view may be used to add software modules for supporting hardware
resources on EVMs or LaunchPads. The same capability could be done in the
Software view by adding a hardware. However the Hardware view provides a
hardware-first perspective to show which software could be used with hardware
resources.

|SLA| also contains a SysConfig training module for most of the platform SDKs
in the Tools folder.

Migrating Board Variant
-----------------------

Sysconfig may also be used to migrate a given project from one board to another
compatible board.

.. note::

    Note that this is a Beta release for the |SDK|.

.. attention::

    Not all migration targets are currently enabled or fully supported, and may
    require additional steps. In particular, note that PHY and radio settings
    are not common across all devices. A migration may result in the loss of
    current PHY and radio configurations and/or require the user to update
    settings such as RF commands and high PA setup. For more migration
    information please refer to the guidelines shown in step 3.

Here are the steps:

1. Check the current device variant, by right-clicking on the project, then
   select "Properties".
   Now, you can see the device variant as shown here:

    .. figure:: /sysconfig/resources/board_migration/check_orig_variant.PNG
        :align: center

        Original Device Variant

2. Open the project's .syscfg file, navigate to Device view, then click
   "SWITCH".

3. The guidelines for migration on your specific project will be shown, and may
   differ from the screenshot. Please consider the guidelines while using this
   migration feature.
   Now, select a compatible device for migration, click "CONFIRM", and ctrl-s to
   save the .syscfg file.

    .. figure:: /sysconfig/resources/board_migration/select_migrate_target.PNG
        :align: center

        Select Migration Target

4. The device variant for the project should now be switched!
   This switch selects the board's respective target configuration file,
   chooses which driver libraries are used, and updates files to be generated by
   SysConfig. Like always, you can preview the changes to SysConfig-generated
   files (see :ref:`sysconfig-board-files`).
   Note that this switch leaves most of the project unaffected, such as project
   name and application files.
