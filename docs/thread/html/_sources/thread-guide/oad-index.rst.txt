Over-the-Air Download (OAD)
###########################

The following sections aim to describe the lower layers of OAD software that
are common across all protocol stack implementations. This includes the OAD
image header, the flash layout, Boot Image Manager (:term:`BIM`), and the
``oad_image_tool``.

.. warning::

    The |STACK| OAD module does not implement or perform any security or
    authentication mechanisms as part of the firmware update process. System
    developers should take measures to adequately authenticate peer devices
    and only accept and/or apply firmware images transferred from trusted
    sources via OAD.

    When using the Secure OAD feature along with recommended parameters,
    firmware images are authenticated on the device using :term:`ECDSA`
    signature validation algorithms to ensure image authenticity prior to
    updating the running firmware image.

.. note::

    The |STACK| does not support on-chip OAD. All references to on-chip OAD in
    the OAD chapter can be ignored.

The following sections aim to describe the |STACK| specific protocol and
application layer of the OAD solution. The native OAD section will describe
the |STACK| OAD process from a high level in terms of events and states, as
well as providing a detailed description of the actual structures that are
sent over the air. The non-native OAD section described how an OAD-enabled
|STACK| image can be transported over any other TI wireless stack that
supports OAD.
