Power Management
----------------

All power-management functionality is handled by the TI-RTOS power driver and
is used by the peripheral drivers (e.g. UART, SPI, I2C, etc..). Applications
can prevent, if they choose, the |DEVICE| from entering low power modes by
setting a power constraint.


With |STACK| applications, the power constraint is set in ``ti_zstack_config.h`` 
for End Device types by defining the ``RFD_RCVC_ALWAYS_ON`` preprocessor symbol
as ``FALSE``.  With ``ZG_BUILD_ENDDEVICE_TYPE`` defined, the device enters and 
exits sleep as required for |STACK| events, peripheral events, application 
timers, and so forth. Coordinator and Router Zigbee device types must always stay
awake to properly route packets.

More information on power-management functionality, including the API and a
sample use case for a custom UART driver, can be found in the TI-RTOS Power
Management for |DEVICE| included in the |SDK| install. These APIs are
required only when using a custom driver.
