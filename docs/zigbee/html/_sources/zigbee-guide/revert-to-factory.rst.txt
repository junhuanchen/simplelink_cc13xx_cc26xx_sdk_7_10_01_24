Reverting to a Factory Image
============================

Each OAD enabled application has enabled a mechanism in to revert to the factory
image. This section will detail how to invalidate the current application image
to revert to the factory image.

#. Hold down the left button on the |LP|.
#. While holding down the left button, press the reset button.

    - On boot, the application will check the pin state and jump to the
      invalidate routine.

The process for invalidating the current image is as follows:

    - The application corrupts the CRC status field in the
      :ref:`sec-oad-image-header` by flipping a bit.
    - The application reboots the device.
    - The BIM will search for valid images, and since no new downloads have been
      performed, it will not find any.
    - At this point as a failsafe, the BIM will revert the factory image.
      See :ref:`sec-oad-bim-off-chip`.

.. note::
    The application should check that a valid factory image is present before
    invalidating itself. It can do so by ensuring there is valid metadata in
    external flash page 0. See :ref:`sec-oad-ext-flash-image-header`.
