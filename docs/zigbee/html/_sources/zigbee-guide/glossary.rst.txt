    CCA
    CCFG
    Customer Configuration Area 

        Customer Configuration is set by the application and contains
        configuration parameters for the ROM boot code, device hardware, and
        device firmware. It contains lock-bits on the last page of flash. You
        can read more in the Customer Configuration section in the |TRM|.

    CCS
    Code Composer Studio

        An integrated development environment to develop applications for
        Texas Instruments embedded processors. Download: `Code Composer
        Studio`_

    cJTAG
    compact JTAG

        Class 4 IEEE 1149.7: Standard for Reduced-pin and
        Enhanced-functionality Test Access Port and Boundary-scan Architecture.
        This is known by acronym cJTAG.

    CSMA-CA

        Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance

        Common User Interface

    DMM
    Dynamic Multi-protocol Manager

        An arbiter between multiple protocol stacks that are sharing the multi
        mode RF driver and thus the radio. The DMM aides in scheduling radio
        operations by way of application provided state information and timing
        constraints.

    GCC
    GNU Compiler Collection

        A compiler system produced by the GNU Project, which support various
        programming languages such as C and C++.

    GPD

        Green Power Device

    GPP

        Green Power Proxy

    GPRAM
    General purpose RAM 

        This memory area is used for the cache per default,
        but can be configured to be used as RAM.

    GPS

        Green Power Sink

    IAR

        Refers to IAR Systems' IAR Embedded Workbench, which is an integrated
        development environment used for building and debugging embedded
        applications.

    ICALL

        Indirect Call

    IEEE 802.15.4

        The Institue of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802.15.4 protocol
        specifies the physical and medium access layers for wireless Personal
        Area Networks targeted at low power, low data rate applications

    JTAG
    Joint Test Action Group
    
        IEEE standard 1149.1: Standard Test Access Port and Boundary Scan
        Architecture Test Access Port (TAP). This standard is known by the
        acronym JTAG.

    LQI
    Link Quality Indicator

        A measurement of the quality of a received packet. LQI measurements are
        performed on by the RF core by measuring the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
        of the desired signal to the in-band noise.

    MCU
    Microcontroller Unit

        A small computer on a single integrated circuit.

    MT

        Monitor and Test

    OSAL

        Operating System Abstraction Layer

    OTA

        Over the Air

    OTA Client

        A device capable of downloading an image from an :term:`OTA Server`
        using the OTA cluster

    OTA Server

        A device capable of hosting an image for download by an :term:`OTA Client` 
        using the OTA cluster

    PAN

        Personal Area Network

    ROM
    Read-only Memory

        Type of non-volatile memory used in computers. Once data is written to
        ROM, the data cannot be removed and can only be read.

    RSSI
    Received Signal Strength Indicator

        It is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal.

    RTSC
    Real Time Software Components

        A toolset for creating reusable code, used by TI-RTOS. See
        `RTSC <http://www.eclipse.org/rtsc/>`_ and `RTSC-Pedia
        <http://rtsc.eclipse.org/docs-tip/Main_Page>`_.

        Software Development Kit

    SNV
    Simple Non-Volatile storage

        An abstraction layer used by the |STACK| for reading and writing to
        non volatile memory. This region can also be used by the user.

    SoC
    System on Chip

        Processor core and radio are integrated on same device.

    VIMS

        Versatile Instruction Memory System, a system control module that 
        handles access to the device memory areas from the CPU and system bus.
