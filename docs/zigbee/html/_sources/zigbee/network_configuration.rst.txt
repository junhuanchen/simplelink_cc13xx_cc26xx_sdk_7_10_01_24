Changing Stack Parameters
=========================

The following sections provide the name and description of the most significant variables
to be considered when designing a mesh network.  They are ordered by project location as 
can be found in an imported |STACK| project.

    .. note::
        Be sure to perform a clean build (**Project** |rarr| **Clean**) after
        configuring a parameter to ensure that the changes take effect.

Zigbee Device
-------------

Location: Project output folder |rarr| ``default/syscfg/ti_zstack_config.h``

  - ``DEFAULT_CHANLIST``: Set of 2.4-GHz channels that the Zigbee device will first attempt to operate on
  - ``SECONDARY_CHANLIST``: Set of 2.4-GHz channels to use if ``DEFAULT_CHANLIST`` is unsuitable
  - ``ZDAPP_CONFIG_PAN_ID``: Default PAN ID the coordinator will use to form the network, setting to 0xFFFF results in a random assignment
  - ``NWK_INDIRECT_MSG_TIMEOUT``: Maximum time that parent will buffer indirect messages for its sleeping end devices
  - ``APSC_MAX_FRAME_RETRIES``: Maximum number of APS layer retries after a missed APS ACK
  - ``NWK_MAX_DATA_RETRIES``: Maximum number of NWK layer retries
  - ``ZMAC_MAX_FRAME_RETRIES``: Maximum number of MAC frame transmission retries
  - ``MAX_RTG_ENTRIES``: Maximum number of AODV routing entries, maintained by ``ROUTE_EXPIRY_TIME``
  - ``DEFAULT_KEY``: Default network security key, if set to all 0x00 then a random key will be generated
  - ``DEFAULT_TC_LINK_KEY``: Pre-configured Trust Center link key and must remain as default for Zigbee Alliance 3.x compliance
  - ``RFD_RCVC_ALWAYS_ON``: Determines whether an end device is allowed to enter standby mode for low power operation
  - ``POLL_RATE``: End device time delay before requesting data from its parent, must be shorter than the ``END_DEV_TIMEOUT_VALUE`` to avoid being aged out
    and can be disabled by setting the value to 0xFFFFFFFF
  - ``MINIMUM_APP_POLL_RATE``: Limit to the frequency of end device polls while the application is operational
  - ``TXPOWER``: Determined output power of the device in dBm
  - ``NWK_MAX_DEVICE_LIST``: Number of direct children supported by the association table, further maintained by child aging
  - ``ZDSECMGR_TC_DEVICE_MAX``: Maximum number of unique trust center link keys supported (and therefore Zigbee 3.x devices allowed) in the network
  - ``END_DEV_TIMEOUT_VALUE``: Timeout value for child aging as sent by the end device during the NWK association's end device timeout request

Network Parameters
------------------

Location: ``Stack/nwk/nwk_globals.h``

  - ``NWK_LINK_STATUS_PERIOD``: Interval for which link status reports are broadcast on the network, a jitter mask of ``LINK_STATUS_JITTER_MASK`` is used
  - ``MAX_NEIGHBOR_ENTRIES``: Number of neighbors supported by the neighbor table, maintained by ``NWK_ROUTE_AGE_LIMIT``
  - ``MAX_RTG_SRC_ENTRIES``: Number of cached source routes, coordinator MTO-routing specific and should equal the max number of nodes in the the network
  - ``SRC_RTG_EXPIRY_TIME``: Hop count for concentrator route discoveries, pertains only to coodinator MTO-routing

Z-Stack Parameters
------------------

Location: ``Stack/sys/zglobals.h``

  - ``MAX_MISSING_MAC_ACK_LINK_FAILURE``: Maximum retries for an end device not receiving ACKs
  - ``CONCENTRATOR_ENABLE``: Set to TRUE for coordinator MTO routing
  - ``CONCENTRATOR_DISCOVERY_TIME``: MTO RREQ broadcast period in seconds, set to zero to disable
  - ``CONCENTRATOR_ROUTE_CACHE``: Source route cache table, setting to TRUE is recommended for applications with allowable RAM space
  - ``NWK_END_DEVICE_LEAVE_TIMEOUT``: Further time for which a leave request will be queued for children who have unknowingly aged out

Base Device Behavior
--------------------

Location: ``Stack/bdb/bdb.h``

  - ``TCLK_POLL_RATE``: Poll rate for the Trust Center link key exchange process
  - ``BDB_DEFAULT_TC_LINK_KEY_EXCHANGE_ATTEMPS_MAX``: Number of times a device will attempt a link key exchange with the trust center
  - ``BDBC_TC_LINK_KEY_EXANGE_TIMEOUT``: Time before link exchange fails, at which point the device will try again if attempts remain

Location: ``Stack/bdb/bdb_interface.h``

  - ``BDBC_MIN_COMMISSIONING_TIME``: Length of time to commission the network for which permit join is enabled, a maximum of 254 seconds is required in accordance with Zigbee 2015 and later specification
  - ``BDB_INSTALL_CODE_USE``: Defines which method of install code is used if enabled
  - ``BDB_DEFAULT_JOIN_USES_INSTALL_CODE_KEY``: Enables install codes if set to TRUE
  - ``BDB_DEFAULT_TC_REQUIRE_KEY_EXCHANGE``: Leave ``FALSE`` to allow pre-Zigbee 3.x devices to join the network
