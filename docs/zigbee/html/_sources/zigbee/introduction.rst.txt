|STACKVER| is a component of the |SDK_URL|, which contains the supported software for
the |DEVICEAND|. |STACK| includes the Zigbee\ |reg| 3.0 Specification on top of the IEEEâ„¢ 802.15.4
Specification with the added benefit of running TI-RTOS7. Please refer
to the :ref:`z-stack-overview` section for more information about the
|STACK| implementation. The |SDK| supports a Zigbee PRO 2017 (R22) certified solution,
which runs on the SimpleLink MCU framework (TI-RTOS7, CCS / CCS Cloud). |STACK| contains everything 
needed for a Zigbee certified solution, including tools, application examples, documentation, 
and source code. Application examples are Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL) v7 certification-compliant 
and include a door lock, light, switch, temperature sensor and thermostat.  Green Power (GP) 
device and sink examples have also been provided for select applications. Zigbee Network Processor 
(ZNP) configurations are also supported for two-chip architectures in which a host implements the 
(ZCL) and application.

    Examples of Zigbee end product applications.

Zigbee is a higly interoperable, standards-based, wireless mesh
technology for integrating monitoring, control, and sensor 
network applications into the Internet of Things.  Based on the 
universal IEEE 802.15.4 standard, Zigbee was created to address 
the need for a cost-effective, standards-based wireless networking 
solution that supports low data-rates, low-power consumption,
security, and reliability. With its support of self-healing mesh
networking, Zigbee offers support for both centralized and
decentralized network topologies. It allows nodes to find new routes
throughout the network if one route fails, making it a robust
wireless solution.

A technology specifically targeted for wireless sensor
networks, Zigbee can be used in any monitoring
and control application that requires a wireless link. The
primary target markets are:

-   Building automation and home control/security
-   Advanced metering and smart energy
-   Commercial building automation and lighting control
-   Medical/patient monitoring
-   Logistics and asset tracking
-   Energy harvesting
