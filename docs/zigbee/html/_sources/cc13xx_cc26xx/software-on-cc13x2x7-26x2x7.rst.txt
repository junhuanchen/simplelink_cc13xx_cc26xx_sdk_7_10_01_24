Running Software Examples on the |DEVICE7|
==========================================

.. note::
     The software images built for |DEVICE1| cannot be directly used on
     |DEVICE7|. The software should be recompiled for |DEVICE7| as described
     below.

Porting Software Examples for the |DEVICE7|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |DEVICE7| is pin compatible with, and functionally identical to, their
respective |DEVICE1| devices but with an additional 352 kB of flash memory
and extra 64 kB of RAM. However, it is not currently possible to use the
:ref:`sec-sysconfig-migrate-device` tool to change the device types of 
projects using |DEVICE1| to |DEVICE7|.  Developers are strongly encouraged 
to import a project which contains the correct settings for their target 
device and port the stack application accordingly.  Example projects can be 
found from the following location:

<SDK_DIR>\\examples\\rtos\\<LaunchPad variant>\\<stack>\\<application>\\tirtos\\<ccs/iar>

Choosing LaunchPad for Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|DEVICE1| LaunchPads are pin-to-pin compatible with |DEVICE7| hardware.  
Therefore the on-board devices of these LaunchPads can be swapped for the 
desired |DEVICE7| variant if specific hardware is not readily available.  
As mentioned in the previous section, the correct example project must be 
selected for the specific device being used.

Moving From LaunchPad to Custom Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can find instructions on how to design and configure a custom board in the 
:ref:`sec-custom-hardware` chapter.
