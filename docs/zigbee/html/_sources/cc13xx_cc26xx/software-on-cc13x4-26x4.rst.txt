Running Software Examples on the |DEVICE1M|
===========================================

Software Examples for the |DEVICE1M|
------------------------------------

It is not currently possible to use the
:ref:`sec-sysconfig-migrate-device` tool to change the device types of
projects using |DEVICE1| to |DEVICE1M|.  Developers are strongly encouraged
to import a project which contains the correct settings for their target
device and port the stack application accordingly. Example projects can be found
in the following location:

<SDK_DIR>\\examples\\rtos\\<LaunchPad variant>\\<stack>\\<application>\\tirtos\\<ticlang/iar>

For LP-EM-CC1314R10, LP-EM-CC1354P10-1 and LP-EM-CC1354P10-6, software examples
are provided in the |SDK|.

If your product will use CC1354R10, CC2674R10 or CC2674P10, the recommendation
is to start with a LP-EM-CC1354P10 software example.

Migrate Your CC13x2 or CC26x2 Project
-------------------------------------

This section will describe a way to migrate an existing project to the CC13x4 or
CC26x4 device.

The best way to migrate is to open a new project from the new SDK and transfer
your changes and application code over to the new example.

#. Choose the CC13x4 SDK example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality or corresponds to your existing project.

#. Transfer the SysConfig settings. You can do this through the GUI, or open
   both the old and the new project ``.syscfg`` files in a text comparison
   program and copy-paste the desired settings.

#. Transfer all modified application files from your existing project into the
   CC13x4 example project. If applicable: delete application files that are not
   used from the CC13x4 example project.

You can find instructions on how to design and configure a custom board in the
:ref:`sec-custom-hardware` chapter.

Specific Software Changes from CC13x2 and CC26x2 Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your project has not been updated to the latest SDK, you may run into one or
more of the following limitations:

Memory
""""""
The |DEVICE1M| devices contain 1M (1024KB) internal flash and 256KB RAM.

ROM
"""
On |DEVICE1M| devices, there is no RTOS or connectivity stack in ROM. Instead,
the RTOS and stacks are stored in flash. There are no required software changes.

PIN and GPIO Drivers
""""""""""""""""""""
Legacy PIN drivers are not supported on |DEVICE1M| devices. Instead you should
use the GPIO++ driver. For more information about GPIO++ driver, refer to the
migration guide :ref:`sec-cc13xx-cc26xx-gpio++-porting-guide`

UART Driver
"""""""""""
The legacy UART driver is not supported. Instead use the new UART2 driver.
More information available in the :ref:`uart_to_uart2-porting-guide`.

RTOS
""""
|DEVICE1M| devices will only support TI-RTOS7 and FreeRTOS, not legacy TI-RTOS
(also called RTOS6 or BIOS6). More information about TI-RTOS7 is available here:
:ref:`tirtos_to_tirtos7-porting-guide`.


Migrate software examples from CC13x4 to CC26x4
-----------------------------------------------
This section provides the necessary steps to migrate an existing software example or project
from a **CC1354P10_x** device to a CC26x4 device. This assumes you have imported a CC1354P10_x project
into your |CCS| workspace.

.. ifconfig:: doctarget == 'ble5'

   .. note::
      When migrating to the CC2674R10, start with the CC1354P10_1 project.

      When migrating to the CC2674P10, start with the CC1354P10_6 project.

#. To avoid confusion, it is advised to rename the project before proceeding with the porting effort.
   To rename the project, right click on the imported project, select the rename option and provide a new name for
   the project in the pop up.

   .. figure:: resources/rename_project.png
      :name: fig-rename-project
      :align: center

#. Go to Project properties, in the predefined symbols section, change `DeviceFamily_CC13X4`
   to `DeviceFamily_CC26X4`.

   .. figure:: resources/predefined_symbol_cc26x4.png
      :name: fig-predefined-symbol_cc26x4
      :align: center

#. Make sure that the SysConfig product associated with the project is version 1.16.2 or later.
   This ensures that SysConfig has the metadata for your CC26x4 device.

   .. figure:: resources/sysconfig_version.png
      :name: fig-sysconfig_version
      :align: center

#. Open the device view of SysConfig and click on the **Switch** option.

   .. figure:: resources/switch_device.png
      :name: fig_switch_device
      :align: center

#. Select the required target device and select the board as 'None'. Ensure that you have left
   the Lock PinMux selection unchecked. This is necessary because we still need to edit the pin mapping to fit our
   custom board design.

   .. figure:: resources/board_device_selection.png
      :name: fig_select_device_board
      :align: center

   .. ifconfig:: doctarget == 'ble5'

      .. note::

         When migrating through IAR using ``simple_peripheral``,
         ``simple_central``, or ``multi_role``, the following
         steps must also be done:

         #. Right click on the Project and click on ``Options...``.

         #. In the newly opened ``Options`` window, click on
            ``C/C++ Compiler`` and add the ``DeviceFamily_CC26X4``
            and ``CC13X4`` defines to the ``Defined symbols`` section.


After clicking "Confirm", SysConfig will perform best-effort device migration. Most settings will be correctly migrated,
but sometimes (e.g. pin assignments to custom boards) SysConfig cannot select a good default for the new environment.
In these cases, SysConfig will highlight settings that must be manually reviewed with warnings and/or errors.
Some of these errors and warnings are illustrated below.

.. caution::
   The following steps are provided for reference only. These are based on mounting a CC2674R10 device on a LP-CC2652R7 LaunchPad.
   You need to resolve the errors based on your own custom design.

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` If you are using either UART or Display

      Make the UART PinMux selection as shown in the image.

      .. figure:: resources/uart_or_display.png
         :name: fig_uart_or_display
         :align: center

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` If you are using Buttons/Leds

      If you are using BTN-1 or BTN-2 on the board, make the following selection.

      .. figure:: resources/btn_1_and_btn_2.png
         :name: fig_btn_1_and_btn_2
         :align: center

      If you are using the Red LED or the Green LED. make the following selection.

      .. figure:: resources/led_green_and_red.png
         :name: fig_led_green_and_red
         :align: center

      If you are using the Button/LED driver from the `TI DRIVER APPS` section on SysConfig,
      you should make the PinMux selection in the Button or LED sub module.

      .. figure:: resources/ti_driver_apps_btn_led.png
         :name: fig_ti_driver_apps_btn_led
         :align: center

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` If you are using the NVS driver

      The chip select pins must be configured as shown in the figure

      .. figure:: resources/nvs_migration.png
         :name: fig_nvs_migration
         :align: center

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` If you are using the SPI driver

      The SPI pins must be configured as shown in the figure

      .. figure:: resources/spi_migration.png
         :name: fig_spi_migration
         :align: center

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` If you are using MCUBoot and Bootloader Backdoor

      Configure the bootloader backdoor and address of the flash vector table as shown in the picture.

      .. figure:: resources/mcuboot_migration.png
         :name: fig_mcuboot_migration
         :align: center

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` If you are using RF stacks/Proprietary RF

      The RF Design and the XOSC configuration must have the following selections
      irrespective of the wireless stack or custom Phy used.

      In the RF design module, you need to "accept" the changes by clicking on "accepting" in the error message.
      Select "Not used" for the Sub-1GHz Frequency Band, the CC2674x is a 2.4G only device.

      .. figure:: resources/RF_design_migration.png
         :name: fig_rf_migration
         :align: center

      It is also important to un-check the XOSC Cap Array Modification option in `Device Configuration` module.
      If you do not uncheck this, there is an unwanted offset added to the center frequency.

      .. figure:: resources/xosc_cap_array.png
         :name: fig_xosc_cap_array
         :align: center

      .. ifconfig:: doctarget == 'ble5'

         .. note::

            The following two steps only apply when migrating a
            ``host_test`` project and SysConfig errors are generated:

            #. Navigate to the ``Custom`` module in the ``RF Stacks``
               section of SysConfig. Inside the BLE settings tab, change the
               ``TX Power (dBm)`` field to 20 dbm.

            #. Within the BLE settings tab, expand ``Other Dependencies``
               and then expand the ``RF Design`` tab. If an error is
               present in the ``Based On RF Design`` field, then
               click on the ``accepting`` option to dismiss the error.

      .. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` If you are using a custom Phy (IEEE 802.15.4 Phy)

         #. Under Custom Phy selection, click on **here** in the messages to dismiss the errors. These error arise from
            migrating a dual band(2.4G and Sub1G device) to an exclusively 2.4GHz device. We will resolve the errors manually
            in the following steps.

               :name: fig_code_export_proprf
               :align: center

         #. Manually update the RF Command Symbol generated for the CMD_RADIO_SETUP by adding the **ieee154** suffix.

            .. figure:: resources/ieee_suffix.png
               :name: fig_ieee_suffix
               :align: center

      .. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` Regarding antenna switching

         The CC1354P10_x device is a dual band device and also has an additional high PA path, while CC26x4R devices are single band devices (i.e. only have a single RF path at its output).
         Thus, it does not require an antenna switch. In the RF module of SysConfig, you need to reduce the number of antenna switch control pins to 0.

         .. figure:: resources/antenna_switching_disable.png
            :name: fig_antenna_switching_disable
            :align: center

         But please note that if you are migrating to a **CC2674P10** device, due to the presence of an additional high PA RF path, you might need an antenna switch
         and you would have to implement an antenna switching callback to control this antenna switch at the application level.

         For reference implementation, you can check the antenna switching callback found in `ti_drivers_config.c`
         in any prop_rf examples for LP_CC1354P10_x.
