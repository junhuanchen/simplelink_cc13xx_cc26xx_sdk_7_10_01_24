TI Bluetooth Mesh Quick Start Guide
***********************************

This section serves as a road map for users developing applications
and products using the TI SimpleLink |DEVICE| wireless MCU platform for
Bluetooth Mesh applications. Whether a seasoned developer or just getting
started, TI has created a variety of resources to simplify development on the
|DEVICE| platform. These resources will enhance your experience with the TI
SimpleLink |BLE5_STACK| from the out-of-the-box demo to production.

To download the |DEVICE| SDK, please visit the download page:
`http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC13XX-CC26XX-SDK 
<http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC13XX-CC26XX-SDK>`_.


Using Bluetooth Mesh Projects with CCS
======================================

Import Project to CCS Using Resource Explorer
---------------------------------------------

A quick and easy way to start working with the SDK is to use the TI Resource
Explorer in CCS.

This section describes how to import and build an existing project and
references the ``simple_mesh_node`` project.

.. important::
    Bluetooth Mesh is supported on all CC13xx/CC26xx devices. Currently, not all
    example projects are available in the SDK. In this case, start out with any 
    |simple_mesh_node| example and refer to the following 
    `e2e post <https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/bluetooth-group/bluetooth/f/bluetooth-forum/1000102/cc1352r-lpstk-bluetooth-mesh-support-project>`_ for further instructions.

#. Open the CCS IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Create a workspace.

    .. tip::

        Ensure that the CCS workspace path does not contain a whitespace.

#. Import a CCS Project using Resource Explorer

    - Open Resource Explorer (if not open already): View -> Resource Explorer
    - Navigate to the CCS folder for your chosen example:
      Software |rarr| |SDK| |rarr| Examples |rarr| Development Tools |rarr|
      |LP| |rarr| BLE5-Stack |rarr| simple\_mesh\_node |rarr| TI-RTOS |rarr|
      CCS Compiler |rarr| simple\_mesh\_node

#.  Select the CCS Logo button to import project into Project Explorer

    .. attention::

        The import process will also install the |SDK| if a local version does
        not exist. You must accept the End User License Agreement to proceed.

        .. figure:: resources/eula.png
            :align: center

            Install |SDK|

        After the installation finishes, you must reopen CCS before importing
        the project.

    - If everything is successful, the project should appear in Resource
      Explorer: simple\_mesh\_node\_CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs.

Build and Download Project
--------------------------

To build & download simple mesh node:

#. Build the project.

    - Select **Project -> Build All** to build the project.
    - As part of the prebuild process, SysConfig will run and generate code
      based on the ``.syscfg`` in the workspace. For more information on
      SysConfig, see the SysConfig chapter of the User's Guide.

#. Load the project

    - Select **Run** -> **Debug** to download the application to the device

Before beginning execution, open a terminal window with the following settings:

.. table:: Simple Mesh Node UART Settings

    +--------------+----------------+
    | UART Param   | Default Values |
    +==============+================+
    | Baud Rate    | 115200         |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Data length  | 8 bits         |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Parity       | None           |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Stop bits    | 1 bit          |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Flow Control | None           |
    +--------------+----------------+

When the debugging session opens, click the green start button to start 
execution. Continue on to the |simple_mesh_node| example README for information
about using the example.

**Troubleshooting Help**

While working with your application, you may run into issues that require
the use of a debugger. See the *Debugging* chapter in the |BLE5_STACK|
User's Guide for guidance.
