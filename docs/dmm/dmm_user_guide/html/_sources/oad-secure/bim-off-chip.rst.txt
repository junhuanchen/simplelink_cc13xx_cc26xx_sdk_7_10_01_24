BIM for Off-Chip OAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the behavior of the :term:`BIM` for off-chip OAD. This
approach requires an external flash to be connected to the device. As with
on-chip OAD, it is BIM's responsibility to locate which image should be run.

At steady state, the normal case is that a valid image exists in internal flash
and no image in the external flash has been marked as needing to be copied. In
this case, BIM will validate that the image on internal flash and execute it
by loading the stack pointer and jumping to the image's reset vector location.
BIM determines the location of the reset vector and stack pointer of the image
through the OAD image header attached to it.

.. note::

    The execution flow below is assuming security is on. If using an unsecured
    BIM configuration, the process is the same with the exception that there
    is no check for security.

The following flowchart describes the process by which the BIM selects an
image.

.. ifconfig:: device == 'cc2640'

    .. include:: inc_bim-off-chip-flowchart-cc2640.rst

.. ifconfig:: device != 'cc2640'

    .. include:: inc_bim-off-chip-flowchart.rst

The image above is illustrated in words below. In order to determine which
image is best to run, BIM takes the following measures:

#. At startup, BIM looks for a valid image header in external flash by reading
   the first 8 bytes to find the valid External Flash Image Identification
   value.

#. After a valid header is found, it reads the entire header from ext flash
   and verifies the compatibility of BIM and image header versions. Then it
   checks if the 'Image copy status' is set to be copied to the on-chip
   flash(0xFE) and has a valid CRC (CRC status=0xFE).

    - If a compatible header is found, secure versions of the BIM will check
      the signature of the image using ECDSA verification algorithm.

    - If the CRC flag is not valid (CRC status != 0xFE) then it is rejected.

    - On finding the invalid CRC it moves on to read the next image's header.

#. If a valid image is found, BIM copies the image to on-chip flash, as per
   the image copy procedure.

    - After the copy, the CRC is calculated and signature is validated again
      on the internal flash to ensure the copy succeeded.

    - If the copy failed the status byte is updated and the BIM will continue
      searching external flash.

    - If the copy succeeded, then the BIM will verify the image again and if
      successful jump directly to the application image, and the search
      process ends.

#. If BIM reaches the end of the image header region in external flash without
   finding a valid image, then it will try to find an on-chip image and
   execute it.

#. If BIM fails to find a valid image internal flash, it will attempt to
   revert the factory image if there is one present.

#. BIM will put the device to low power mode if it fails to find a valid
   application image.

.. note::

    An image is considered bad/invalid if it's calculated CRC32 does not match
    the image's CRC bytes embedded in the image header.
