    Suggested Workflow


Example Projects
================

For an overview of all the DMM example projects found in the |SDK|, please see 
the Example Applications section of the DMM chapter. Here you will also find some 
notes on the example application design.

A quick and easy way to start working with the SDK is to use the TI Resource
Explorer in CCS. Instructions for using |IAR| are found in the following section 
(:ref:`get-started-dmm-iar`).

Import Project Using Resource Explorer
--------------------------------------

This section describes how to import and build an existing project and
references the ``dmm_154sensor_remote_display`` project. All of the DMM projects 
included in the development kit have a similar structure.

#. Open the CCS IDE.
#. Create a workspace.

    .. attention::

        Ensure that the CCS workspace path does not contain a whitespace.

#. Import a CCS Project using Resource Explorer

    - Open Resource Explorer (if not open already): View -> Resource Explorer
    - Navigate to the CCS folder for your chosen example:
      Software |rarr| |SDK| |rarr| Examples |rarr| Development Tools |rarr|
      |LP| |rarr| dmm |rarr| dmm_154sensor_remote_display |rarr| TI-RTOS |rarr|
      CCS Compiler |rarr| dmm_154sensor_remote_display

    .. figure:: resources/dmm/ccs_import_dmm.png
        :align: center

        Import CCS Projects

#.  Select the CCS Logo button to import project into Project Explorer

    .. attention::

        The import process will also install the |SDK| if a local version does
        not exist. You must accept the End User License Agreement to proceed.

        .. figure:: resources/eula.png
            :align: center

            Install |SDK|

        After the installation finishes, you must reopen CCS before importing
        the project.

    - If everything is successful, the project should appear in Project
      Explorer: dmm_154sensor_remote_display.


Build and Download Project with CCS
-----------------------------------

To build and download a DMM project (e.g. ``dmm_154sensor_remote_display``):

#. (Only for OAD enabled projects:) Flash the BIM hex file.

    - The hex file can be found in examples |rarr| nortos |rarr| |LP|
      |rarr| bim |rarr| hexfiles |rarr| bim_offchip |rarr| Debug_unsecure
    - Use Smart RF Flash Programmer 2 or Uniflash_ to program the hex file.

#. Build the application project.

    - Set the application project as the active project.
    - Select **Project -> Build All** to build the Application project.
    - As part of the prebuild process, SysConfig will run and generate code
      based on the ``.syscfg`` in the workspace. For more information on
      SysConfig, see the SysConfig chapter of the User's Guide.

#. Load the application project

    - Select **Run** -> **Debug** to download the application

Before beginning execution, open a terminal window with the following settings:

.. table:: UART Settings

    +--------------+----------------+
    | UART Param   | Default Values |
    +==============+================+
    | Baud Rate    | 115200         |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Data length  | 8 bits         |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Parity       | None           |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Stop bits    | 1 bit          |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Flow Control | None           |
    +--------------+----------------+

Projects that contain the TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD) Profile will require
you to flash your device with the Boot Image Manager (BIM) hex file. This is
the first step described in section `Build and Download` above. For more
information on the TI OAD Profile and the BIM see the **OAD Chapter** of the
BLE5-Stack User's Guide.


.. _get-started-dmm-iar:

Using DMM Projects with IAR
---------------------------

When building with IAR, it is recommended to enable all build messages. This can 
be done by right-clicking in the Build window and selecting "All" as shown below:

.. figure:: resources/iar_enable_build_messages.png
    :align: center

    Enable All Build Messages

.. warning::
    Standalone SysConfig tool must be installed in order to use all the IAR 
    projects and its location has to the same as specified by ``SYSCONFIG_ROOT``.
         
    The SysConfig standalone package can be found here: `SysConfig Standalone 
    Installer Download Page`_.

Import Project to IAR Using Workspace
-------------------------------------

This section describes how to open and build an existing project and references
the ``dmm_154sensor_remote_display`` project.

Before opening a workspace in IAR, make sure the correct global argument 
variables are used. Below you can see how to add and enable the SDK-global 
argument variables:

.. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_menu.png

    Select Configure Custom Argument Variables from the Tools menu


.. figure:: resources/iar-import-argvars.jpg

    Click on Import... with the Global name space selected. The imported values 
    will persist for other projects also.


.. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_file.png

    Find the Custom Argument Variables file under ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tools/iar``


.. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_selected.png

    Success! Change these paths if you have installed in a different location.

In addition, applications containing the TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD) Profile
will also include the Boot Image Manager (BIM) project. For more
information on the TI OAD Profile and the BIM see the OAD Chapter of the
BLE5-Stack User's Guide.

.. note::
    If you have imported the global
    ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``,
    then the examples from the older SDK will fail to build. If this happens you 
    must remove this custom_argvars file from your IAR global custom arguments 
    and re-open that workspace again.

#. Open the IAR Embedded Workbench IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Open an IAR workspace project: **File** -> **Open** -> **Workspace...**

    - For this example, select
      ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\examples\rtos\<BOARD>\dmm\dmm_154sensor_remote_display\tirtos\iar\dmm_154sensor_remote_display_app_<BOARD>_tirtos_iar.template.eww``

#. This will prompt you to select a folder location as a workspace for the
   project. Make sure you select an empty folder.

This workspace file is for the ``dmm_154sensor_remote_display`` project. When 
selected, the files associated with the workspace become visible in the Workspace 
pane on the left side of the screen. 


Build and Download Project with IAR
-----------------------------------

To build and download a DMM project (e.g. ``dmm_154sensor_remote_display``):

#. (Only for OAD enabled projects:) Flash the BIM hex file.

    - The hex file can be found in examples |rarr| nortos |rarr| |LP|
      |rarr| bim |rarr| hexfiles |rarr| bim_offchip |rarr| Debug_unsecure
    - Use Smart RF Flash Programmer 2 or Uniflash_ to program the hex file.

#. Build the DMM application project.

    - Select the Application project.
    - Select Project -> Make to build the Application project.
    - As part of the prebuild process, SysConfig will run and generate code
      based on the ``.syscfg`` in the workspace. For more information on
      SysConfig, see the SysConfig chapter of the User's Guide.

#. Load the DMM application project

    - To download and debug: Select **Project** -> **Download and Debug**
    - To download without debugging: Select **Project** -> **Download** ->
        **Download Active Application**


Refer to each project README for more information about the project.

Before beginning execution, open a terminal window with the following settings:

.. table:: UART Settings

    +--------------+----------------+
    | UART Param   | Default Values |
    +==============+================+
    | Baud Rate    | 115200         |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Data length  | 8 bits         |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | Parity       | None           |
