Dynamic Multi-protocol Manager (DMM)
====================================

The Dynamic Multi-protocol Manager (:term:`DMM`) allows multiple wireless
stacks to coexist and operate concurrently. It acts as an arbiter between
multiple stacks and the shared RF core resource.

.. note::

    Currently only a subset of stack combinations have been characterized by TI.
    These include combinations of the BLE5-Stack together with the TI 15.4 or 
    Zigbee Stack. This chapter will cover the DMM as generally as possible,
    but when necessary will use the BLE and 15.4-Stacks as examples.
