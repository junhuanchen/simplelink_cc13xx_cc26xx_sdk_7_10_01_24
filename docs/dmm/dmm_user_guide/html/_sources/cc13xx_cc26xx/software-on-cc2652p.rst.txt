Running Software Examples on CC2652P
====================================

Porting Software Examples for CC2652P
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `CC2652P`_ is pin compatible with, and functionally identical to the `CC1352P`_ 
device for 2.4 GHz operation. You can run CC1352P software examples on the 
CC2652P device without making any changes.

.. note:: The also applies to the `CC2652P7`_ in relation to `CC1352P7`_ devices

Choosing LaunchPad for Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All CC1352P LaunchPads can be used for software development for the CC2652P 
device. However, the LaunchPads have been designed with different use-cases in 
mind.

* The `CC1352P1 LaunchPad`_ is optimized for transmitting with the high PA on 
  the Sub 1 GHz frequency band and is thus less suitable for CC2652P development.
* The `CC1352P-4 LaunchPad`_ is optimized to showcase coin cell battery operation 
  while transmitting +10 dBm with the high power PA on the 2.4 GHz frequency 
  band. For more information, see the application note on this topic: 
  `Optimizing the CC1352P and CC2652P for Coin Cell Operation at 10 dBm Output Power`_.
* The `CC1352P-2 LaunchPad`_ is optimized to transmit +20 dBm on the 2.4 GHz 
  frequency band.

Moving From LaunchPad to Custom Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can find instructions on how to design and configure a custom board in the 
:ref:`sec-custom-hardware` chapter.
