Running Software Examples on CC2652XSIP and CC2651RSIPA devices
===============================================================

The system-in-package (SIP) devices have both a 48 MHz crystal and a 32 kHz
crystal integrated in the package thus allowing operation without any external 
components.

The `CC2651RSIPA`_ system-in-package antenna (SIPA) device has both a 48 MHz 
crystal and an antenna integrated in the package thus allowing operation with
only a 32 kHz crystal external component (if necessary).

The `CC2652RSIP`_ has one more DIO (31) than the `CC2652R`_ QFN package. For
more information, please see the `CC2652RSIP`_ data sheet.  For `CC2652RSIP`_,
running software examples is as easy as opening the LP_CC2652RSIP folder and
choosing the desired example.

.. note:: This also applies to the `CC2652PSIP`_ and `CC2651RSIPA`_ devices,
    along with their respective LP_CC2652PSIP and LP_CC2651RSIPA folders

For further information on device and board configurations inside a project,
please see the :ref:`sysconfig-board-files` section.

.. warning:: This note is intended for customers configuring Analog GPIOs
    in CC2651RSIPA projects. SysConfig allows users to configure the ADC/DAC for
    pin ranges DIO23-DIO30 as well as DIO0-DIO7. Although all of these options
    are visible in SysConfig, **DIO0-DIO7 are not Analog capable pins and thus
    should not be used for the ADC/DAC.** For more information, see the
    `CC2651RSIPA`_'s datasheet.

    Customers configuring an ADC/DAC with SysConfig should be cognizant of this
    issue and not incorrectly assign an invalid pin for use with the ADC/DAC.
