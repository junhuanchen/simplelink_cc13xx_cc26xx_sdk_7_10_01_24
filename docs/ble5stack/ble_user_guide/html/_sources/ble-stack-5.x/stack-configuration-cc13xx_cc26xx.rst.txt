Stack Configurations
--------------------

Most projects are using SysConfig to configure the BLE-Stack. See
:ref:`sec-sysconfig-ble-check` for steps on how to check if SysConfig is
enabled for BLE. Based on the selected SysConfig settings, only the necessary
precompiled libraries will be linked to the project.

.. caution::

  Note that the following section applies only to example applications that are
  **not** configuring the BLE-Stack via SysConfig. For information
  about configuring the BLE-Stack with SysConfig see :ref:`sysconfig-ble5`.


Configuring Bluetooth Low Energy Protocol Stack Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack can be configured to include
or exclude certain Bluetooth Low Energy features by changing the
library configuration. The available Bluetooth
Low Energy features are defined in the ``build_config.opt`` file in
the Tools folder of the stack project within the IDE. Based on the features
selected in the ``build_config.opt`` file, the respective precompiled libraries
will be selected during the build process of the stack project.


Run-Time Bluetooth Low Energy Protocol Stack Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack can be configured with
various parameters that control its runtime behavior and RF antenna
layout. The available configuration parameters are described in
the ``ble_user_config.h`` file in the ICallBLE IDE folder of the
application. During initialization, these parameters are supplied to the
Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack by the ``user0Cfg`` structure, declared in
main.c.

.. code-block:: c

  #include "ble_user_config.h"

  // BLE user defined configuration
  bleUserCfg_t user0Cfg = BLE_USER_CFG;

Because the ``ble_user_config.h`` file is shared filed between the Bluetooth
Low Energy projects within the SDK, TI recommends defining configuration
parameters in the ``.opt`` files found under ``TOOLS\defines``. The ``.opt``
files contain preprocessor symbols of the application when the default value
isn't sufficient. For example, to change the maximum PDU size from the default
27 to 162, set the preprocessor symbol ``MAX_PDU_SIZE=162`` in the
preprocessor symbols for the application project. Increasing certain
parameters may increase heap memory use by the protocol stack;
adjust the ``HEAPMGR_SIZE`` as required (if not using auto sized heap).
:numref:`appconfigurablefeatures` and :numref:`stackconfigurablefeatures`
list the available configuration parameters.
