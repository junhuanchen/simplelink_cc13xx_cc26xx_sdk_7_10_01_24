Network Processor Interface (NPI)
*********************************

TI's Network Processor Interface (:term:`NPI`) is used for establishing a serial
data link between a TI SoC and external MCUs or PCs. It is an abstraction layer
above the serial interface (UART or SPI) that handles sending / receiving
data power management, and data parsing. It is mainly used by TI's
network processor solutions.

    There are two types of NPI used by BLE and they are described in the 
    following sections.
