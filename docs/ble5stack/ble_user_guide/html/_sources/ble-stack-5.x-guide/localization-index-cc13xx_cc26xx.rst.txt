RTLS Toolbox

.. warning::
    Only CTE Tx is supported on the |LITEDEVICE| devices.
    Enabling CTE Rx feature on |LITEDEVICE| devices will result in unexpected
    behavior in the |STACK|.

.. Note::
    The RTLS examples, documentation and tools have been updated to follow the
    Appropriate Language nomenclature directive from Bluetooth SIG. Existing
    E2E threads will not be modified and may use the terms *rtls_master* and
    *rtls_slave* instead of *rtls_coordinator* and *rtls_responder*.

The RTLS (Real Time Localization System) Toolbox, is a collection of RTLS
techniques that can be implemented on TIâ€™s standard Bluetooth Low Energy radios
in the CC26xx series. These techniques provide raw data that can be utilized for
developing localization algorithms and secure range bounding other Bluetooth Low
Energy nodes. The two main techniques included in the RTLS toolbox are
RSSI and |CORESPEC| Angle of Arrival.

RSSI details the Received Signal Strength Indication of an incoming
signal and is commonly leveraged for deriving the distance between a receiver
and a transmitter through the process of trilateration in localization
algorithms. The Bluetooth Low Energy stack enables developers to receive the
RSSI of an incoming Bluetooth packet.

|CORESPEC| Angle of Arrival is a technique for finding the direction that an
incoming Bluetooth packet is coming from, creating a basis for triangulation.
The device samples an incoming constant tone and as I/Q data. This raw I/Q data
represents the amplitude and phase data of a signal and this data can be used
to derive the angle the device transmitting the constant tone.

For detailed information on the specific example, see the relevant README.html
file in the
simplelink_cc13xx_cc26xx_sdk_x_xx_xx_xx/examples/rtos/CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL/ble5stack/PROJECT
folder.

Using the raw data provided by the RTLS Toolbox, TI is enabling developers to
improve localization algorithms based on Bluetooth technology by delivering more
data that can be leveraged for trilateration and triangulation.

The inherent flexibility of the |DEVICE| RF Core is what enables this
significant extension of functionality. The main advantages using the |DEVICE|
are that customers can start adding RTLS features and security with little extra
cost, very little extra energy consumption and no increase in peak power.

There are two fundamentally different approaches for localization:
