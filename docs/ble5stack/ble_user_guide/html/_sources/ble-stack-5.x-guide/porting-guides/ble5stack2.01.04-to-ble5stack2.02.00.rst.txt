BLE5-Stack 2.01.04 (SDK 4.30) to BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 (SDK 4.40)
==============================================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 2.01.04 to
a BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 project.

The best way to migrate is to open a new project from the new SDK and transfer 
your changes and application code over to the new example. 

Porting Simple Peripheral
-------------------------

For this migration guide, Simple Peripheral from BLE5-Stack 2.01.04 will be 
ported over to BLE5-Stack 2.02.00. The recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 2.01.04 into the
   BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 2.01.04 were moved into
   Simple Peripheral BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 example:

      - ``simple_peripheral.c``
      - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. Move any profiles and services that the application is using to the 
   BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 project.

#. Transfer the SysConfig settings either visually through the GUI or open both 
   the old and the new project .syscfg files and copy-paste the desired 
   settings.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the 
   TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 uses TI-RTOS see
   :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`.

   For any utilized TI Drivers, review |TI-RTOS_UG_BLE_MG_LOC| and |TI_DRIVERS_API_BLE_MG_LOC|.


A Few Noteworthy Changes from BLE5-Stack 2.01.02 to BLE5-Stack 2.02.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can follow the guide above without addressing these updates, they are listed
for your information only. All fine grained details might not be mentioned, 
please refer to the specific example you need to port and to a compare between 
the old and new project files. Please refer to the BLE5-Stack Release Notes for 
all the details.

* Connectionless-AoA is now supported. For more information, refer to 
  :ref:`sec-aoa`.

* Periodic Advertisements are now supported. For more information, refer to
  :ref:`gap_periodic_advertising`.

* TI clang compiler support was added to BLE projects. See 
  :ref:`get-started-ble5-develop` for a list of projects supported. This change
  required some modifications to code (i.e. passing in "" to functions
  that do not receive any input). When porting, no change is required if the 
  legacy compiler is used.

* Improvements were made to the BLE5 Stack's scheduling of events. For details,
  see :ref:`sec-connection-fairness`.

* A new define was added to gapbondmgr.h. ``GAPBOND_AUTHEN_PAIRING_ONLY`` is
  used to enforce authenticated pairing. Additional checks were added to the
  GAPBondMgr to ensure proper IO capabilities are set when when authenticated
  pairing is used. Refer to :ref:`authentication-pairing-only`.

* The Project Zero data_service.c profile 's *String Characterisitc Value* has 
  been modified to support encrpyted reads/writes. Additionally, in 
  simple_gatt_profile.c, *Simple Profile Characteristic 4 Properties* were 
  modified to support writes in addition to the original notify support 
  (i.e. ``` simpleProfileChar4Props = GATT_PROP_WRITE | GATT_PROP_NOTIFY;)```)
