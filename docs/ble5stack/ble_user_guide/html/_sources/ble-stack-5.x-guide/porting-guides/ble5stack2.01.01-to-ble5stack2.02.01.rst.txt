BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 (SDK 3.40) to BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 (SDK 5.10)
==============================================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 to
a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 project.

The best way to migrate is to open a new project from the new SDK and transfer 
your changes and application code over to the new example. 

Porting Simple Peripheral
-------------------------

This section of the migration guide will focus on porting Simple Peripheral 
from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 to BLE5-Stack 2.02.01. The recommended approach is to 
start with a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 project that contains the same base functionality
as the porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 into the
   BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 were moved into
   Simple Peripheral BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example:

      - ``simple_peripheral.c``
      - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. Add the pointer ``&pRandomAddress``  as argument in the last parameter in 
   GAP_DeviceInit call. This is needed to correctly set a random static address
   if configured.

    .. code-block:: c
      :caption: Added section to handle HCI Events for rejection of peer device Connection parameter update request.
      :linenos:

        GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_PERIPHERAL, selfEntity, addrMode, &pRandomAddress);

#. Add the following code section in ``simple_peripheral.c`` at the end of 
   SimplePeripheral_processGapMessage before the ``default:`` case:

    .. code-block:: c
      :caption: Added section to handle HCI Events for rejection of peer device Connection parameter update request.
      :linenos:

        #if defined ( NOTIFY_PARAM_UPDATE_RJCT )
            case GAP_LINK_PARAM_UPDATE_REJECT_EVENT:
            {
              linkDBInfo_t linkInfo;
              gapLinkUpdateEvent_t *pPkt = (gapLinkUpdateEvent_t *)pMsg;

              // Get the address from the connection handle
              linkDB_GetInfo(pPkt->connectionHandle, &linkInfo);

              // Display the address of the connection update failure
              Display_printf(dispHandle, SP_ROW_STATUS_2, 0,
                             "Peer Device's Update Request Rejected 0x%x: %s", pPkt->opcode,
                             Util_convertBdAddr2Str(linkInfo.addr));

              break;
            }
        #endif

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example if additional tasks were
   added in the BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 project.

#. Move any profiles and services that the application is using to the BLE5-Stack
   2.02.01 project.

#. Transfer the Sysconfig settings either visually through the GUI or open both 
   the old and the new project .syscfg files and copy-paste the desired settings.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS
   examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 2.01.02 uses TI-RTOS see
   :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`.

Porting Simple Central
-------------------------

This section of the migration guide will focus on porting Simple Central 
from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 to the BLE5-Stack 2.02.01. The recommended approach is 
to start with a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 project that contains the same base 
functionality as theporting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 into the
   BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 were moved into
   Simple Central BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example:

      - ``simple_central.c``
      - ``simple_central.h``

#. Add the pointer ``&pRandomAddress``  as argument in the last parameter in 
   GAP_DeviceInit call. This is needed to correctly set a random static address
   if configured.

    .. code-block:: c
      :caption: Added section to handle HCI Events for rejection of peer device Connection parameter update request.
      :linenos:

        GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_CENTRAL, selfEntity, addrMode, &pRandomAddress);

#. Modify ``connRec_t`` definition in ``simple_central.c`` such that the ``addr`` and
   ``charHandle`` are of type ``uint16_t`` as shown below:
   
    .. code-block:: c
      :caption: Changed data type of addr and charHandle
      :linenos:

        // Connected device information
        typedef struct
        {
          uint16_t connHandle;        // Connection Handle
          uint16_t  addr[B_ADDR_LEN];  // Peer Device Address
          uint16_t  charHandle;        // Characteristic Handle
          Clock_Struct *pRssiClock;   // pointer to clock struct
        } connRec_t;

#. Remove the ``DEFAULT_DEV_DISC_BY_SVC_UUID`` definition in ``simple_central.c`` as this
   is now modified through SysConfig.

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example if additional tasks were
   added in the BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 project.

#. Move any profiles and services that the application is using to the BLE5-Stack
   2.02.01 project.

#. Transfer the Sysconfig settings either visually through the GUI or open both 
   the old and the new project .syscfg files and copy-paste the desired settings.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS
   examples included with |SDK|.

A Few Noteworthy Changes from BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 to BLE5-Stack 2.02.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can follow the guide above without addressing these updates, they are listed
for your information only. All fine grained details might not be mentioned, 
please refer to the specific example you need to port and to a compare between 
the old and new project files. Please refer to the BLE5-Stack Release Notes for 
all the details.

* Handling added in application code for HCI Events for rejection of peer 
  device Connection parameter update request (``NOTIFY_PARAM_UPDATE_RJCT``).

* Define ``NVOCMP_NWSAMEITEM`` (set to avoid re-writing the same NV item) and 
  define ``FLASH_ROM_BUILD`` added to project.

* Define ``DEFAULT_DEV_DISC_BY_SVC_UUID`` is now controlled in the checkbox
  SysConfig->Observer Configuration->Discover Devices By Service UUID. This is 
  used in multi_role and the simple_central example.

* Privacy Override Offset (``privOverrideOffset``) and CoEx configuration 
  (``coexUseCaseConfig``) added to ``llUserCfg_t``. Configured in 
  ``ble_user_config_stack.c``.

* Updated code in osal_icall_ble.c to match the extended number of 
  parameters in ``GATTServApp_Init()`` and ``GAPBondMgr_Init()``. Parameters 
  ``cfg_GATTServApp_att_delayed_req`` and 
  ``cfg_GATTServApp_gatt_no_service_changed`` are added.

* GAP Scanner has now the ability to select only to scan on specified channels 
  rather all 3 channels.

* Non Volatile On-Chip Multi Page (NVOCMP) Driver now allow the user to check 
  when the next compaction will takes place and receive low voltage detection 
  notifications.

* GAPBondMgr can be configured to delete a bond even while the device is in an 
  active connection.

* The BLE stack library files (OneLib.a and StackWrapper.a) required by
  the linker are not directly provided by the .projectspec (CCS) or the
  .ipcf (IAR). From now on, the file ti_utils_build_linker.cmd.genlibs,
  generated by SysConfig, includes the libraries required to link the 
  application based on the configurations chosen.

* Connectionless-AoA is now supported. For more information, refer to 
  :ref:`sec-aoa`.

* Periodic Advertisements are now supported. For more information, refer to
  :ref:`gap_periodic_advertising`.

* TI clang compiler support was added to BLE projects. See 
  :ref:`get-started-ble5-develop` for a list of projects supported. This change
  required some modifications to code (i.e. passing in "" to functions
  that do not receive any input). When porting, no change is required if the 
  legacy compiler is used.

* Improvements were made to the BLE5 Stack's scheduling of events. For details,
  see :ref:`sec-connection-fairness`.

* A new define was added to gapbondmgr.h. ``GAPBOND_AUTHEN_PAIRING_ONLY`` is
  used to enforce authenticated pairing. Additional checks were added to the
  GAPBondMgr to ensure proper IO capabilities are set when when authenticated
  pairing is used. Refer to :ref:`authentication-pairing-only`.

* The Project Zero data_service.c profile 's *String Characterisitc Value* has 
  been modified to support encrpyted reads/writes. Additionally, in 
  simple_gatt_profile.c, *Simple Profile Characteristic 4 Properties* were 
  modified to support writes in addition to the original notify support 
  (i.e. ``` simpleProfileChar4Props = GATT_PROP_WRITE | GATT_PROP_NOTIFY;)```)

* Agama 704 device support has been added to SDK.

* Examples for Agama 704 devices have been added to SDK.

* Agama 704 devices included in SysConfig.
