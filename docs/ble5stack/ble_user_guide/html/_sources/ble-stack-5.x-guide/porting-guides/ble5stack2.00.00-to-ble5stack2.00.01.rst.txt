BLE5-Stack 2.00.00 to BLE5-Stack 2.00.01
========================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 2.00.00 to
a BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 project.

.. note::
    There now exists a GUI to assist in creating and configuring applications. See
    :ref:`sysconfig-sysconfig`

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE5-Stack 2.00.00 will be
ported over to BLE5-Stack 2.00.01. Because the directory structure is nearly
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 example project that contains your target project's base functionality.

    For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

    In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
    BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 2.00.00 into the BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 example project.

    In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 2.00.00 were moved into
    simple\_peripheral BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 example if additional tasks were
   added in the BLE5-Stack 2.00.00 project.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.

    For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 2.00.01 uses TI-RTOS see
    :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`

    For any utilized TI Drivers, review |TI-RTOS_UG_BLE_MG_LOC| and |TI_DRIVERS_API_BLE_MG_LOC|.
