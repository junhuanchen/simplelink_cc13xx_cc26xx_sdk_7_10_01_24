CC2640R2 to CC26x2
******************

This section describes the main differences an Application Developer must
be aware of between the CC2640R2 and the CC26x2 along with a porting guide to
demonstrate the migration effort.

Features and Benefits
=====================

Increased Processing Power and Scalability
------------------------------------------

The CC26x2 is a wireless MCU with a dedicated Arm Cortex-M4F application
processor that is pin-to-pin compatible to the CC2640R2 in the 7x7mm QFN
package.

More memory is available with an increase of non-volatile memory from
275kB to 608kB. This breaks down into 352kB Flash memory + 256 KB ROM.
RAM has also increased from 28 kB to 80 kB.
The availability of this increased memory provides support for
Over-the-Air Downloads (OAD), larger applications, and more simultaneous
connections.

Other improvements include an additional UART and a 70% reduction in current
consumption in the Sensor Controller.

Bluetooth 5.2 Enabled
---------------------

If your project wasn't already on a BLE5 platform, the CC26x2 will provide the
ability to support the features of Bluetooth 5.2. This includes features such as
higher throughput, longer range, advertising extensions, and improved
coexistence with other wireless technology. For a full list of supported
features, see :any:`sec-ble-stack-feature-intro`.

Enhanced Security
-----------------

With additional hardware security accelerators for AES-128/256, SHA-256, and
ECC, CC26x2 saves five times the processing time and current consumption for
implementing security algorithms.  This is critical to enable strong network
security.

|LP_CC26xx| Support
-------------------

All example applications are compatible with the |LP_CC26xx| development
kit. These features allow for a unified development experience and empowers
developers to rapidly release to market.

For more information on this device, see the |LP_CC26xx| tool page.

Compatibility Notes
===================

Due to a number of improvements and feature additions, the recommended migration
path for customers is to start with a CC26x2 based project and migrate any
custom application code and project configuration to the new project.

The following sections describe, in general terms, the software differences when
migrating from CC2640R2 to CC26x2.
