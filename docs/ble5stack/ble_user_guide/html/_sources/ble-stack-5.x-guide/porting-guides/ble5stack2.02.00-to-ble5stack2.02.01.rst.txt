BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 (SDK 4.40) to BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 (SDK 5.10)
==============================================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 to
a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 project.

The best way to migrate is to open a new project from the new SDK and transfer 
your changes and application code over to the new example. 

Porting Simple Peripheral
-------------------------

For this migration guide, Simple Peripheral from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 will be 
ported over to BLE5-Stack 2.02.01. The recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 into the
   BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 were moved into
   Simple Peripheral BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example:

      - ``simple_peripheral.c``
      - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. Move any profiles and services that the application is using to the 
   BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 project.

#. Transfer the SysConfig settings either visually through the GUI or open both 
   the old and the new project .syscfg files and copy-paste the desired 
   settings.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the 
   TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 uses TI-RTOS see
   :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`.

   For any utilized TI Drivers, review |TI-RTOS_UG_BLE_MG_LOC| and |TI_DRIVERS_API_BLE_MG_LOC|.


Porting Simple Central
-------------------------

This section of the migration guide will focus on porting Simple Central 
from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 to the BLE5-Stack 2.02.01. The recommended approach is 
to start with a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 project that contains the same base 
functionality as theporting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 into the
   BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 were moved into
   Simple Central BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example:

      - ``simple_central.c``
      - ``simple_central.h``

#. Modify ``connRec_t`` definition in ``simple_central.c`` such that the 
   ``charHandle`` is of type ``uint16_t`` as shown below:
   
    .. code-block:: c
      :caption: Changed data type of addr and charHandle
      :linenos:

        // Connected device information
        typedef struct
        {
          uint16_t connHandle;        // Connection Handle
          uint16_t  addr[B_ADDR_LEN];  // Peer Device Address
          uint16_t  charHandle;        // Characteristic Handle
          Clock_Struct *pRssiClock;   // pointer to clock struct
        } connRec_t;

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 2.02.01 example if additional tasks were
   added in the BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 project.

#. Move any profiles and services that the application is using to the BLE5-Stack
   2.02.01 project.

#. Transfer the Sysconfig settings either visually through the GUI or open both 
   the old and the new project .syscfg files and copy-paste the desired settings.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS
   examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 2.01.01 uses TI-RTOS see
   :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`.

   For any utilized TI Drivers, review |TI-RTOS_UG_BLE_MG_LOC| and |TI_DRIVERS_API_BLE_MG_LOC|.


A Few Noteworthy Changes from BLE5-Stack 2.02.00 to BLE5-Stack 2.02.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can follow the guide above without addressing these updates, they are listed
for your information only. All fine grained details might not be mentioned, 
please refer to the specific example you need to port and to a compare between 
the old and new project files. Please refer to the BLE5-Stack Release Notes for 
all the details.

* Agama 704 device support has been added to SDK.

* Examples for Agama 704 devices have been added to SDK.

* Agama 704 devices included in SysConfig.
