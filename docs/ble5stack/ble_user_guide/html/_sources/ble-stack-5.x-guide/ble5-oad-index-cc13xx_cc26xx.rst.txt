TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD)
##############################

The following sections aim to describe the lower layers of OAD software that are
common across all protocol stack implementations. This includes the OAD image
header, the flash layout, Boot Image Manager, and the oad\_image\_tool.

.. warning::

    The BLE-Stack OAD Profile does not implement or perform any security or
    authentication mechanisms as part of the firmware update process.
    System developers should take measures to adequately authenticate peer
    devices and only accept and/or apply firmware images transferred from
    trusted sources via the OAD Profile. TI recommends applications use
    Bluetooth LE Secure Connections (LESC) with Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
    protection with peer devices when performing wireless firmware updates,
    although the use of the LESC feature does not itself guarantee image
    authenticity.

    When using the Secure OAD feature along with recommended parameters,
    firmware images are authenticated on the device using ECDSA signature
    validation algorithms to ensure image authenticity prior to updating the
    running firmware image. Just as with the OAD Profile, TI recommends
    applications use Bluetooth LE Secure Connections with Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
    protection with peer devices when performing wireless firmware updates.

The following sections aim to describe the |STACK| specific application and
profile layer of the OAD solution. The OAD application section will describe
the BLE OAD process from a high level in terms of events and states, and the
profile section will cover the actual structures that are sent over the air.

See :ref:`oad_reference` for more information about the various OAD APIs and
structures.

Mobile developers wishing to make applications that integrate the TI OAD
should refer to the following sample implementations. These are intended
as reference libraries that implement the TI OAD Downloader for Android and iOS.

    - ios-cocoapod-eoad_.
    - android-eoad_

.. _ios-cocoapod-eoad: https://git.ti.com/simplelink-ble-oad-ios
.. _android-eoad: https://git.ti.com/simplelink-ble-oad-android

.. note::

    The above libraries do not implement full fledged applications, but instead
    are intended to be integrated as part of an end application.
