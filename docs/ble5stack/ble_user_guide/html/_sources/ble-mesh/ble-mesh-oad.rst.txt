TI Bluetooth Mesh and OAD
=========================

The following section covers BLE Over the Air Download (OAD) in the context of 
Bluetooth Mesh applications. For general OAD information, please refer to the 
OAD Guide :ref:`sec-oad` for more details about OAD.

    Mesh OAD Application Configuration Overview

:numref:`mesh-oad-config` shows the options and relevant defines that enable OAD
support in the simple_mesh_node application.

When a simple_mesh_node is configured to support OAD, the node concurrently 
supports both a BLE connection in parallel with Bluetooth mesh support. This 
means that a mesh node will send both connectable advertisements 
(as a peripheral for OAD), and also advertise/receive mesh network payloads over
the advertisement (PB-ADV) bearer (as a peripheral + observer).

Once the OAD is started, the OAD distributor device will connect to each mesh 
node using a typical GATT based connection. During this time, the OAD 
distributor will send the new firmware over the air to the mesh node in 
successive blocks. 

If **off-chip** OAD is used, the Bluetooth mesh node will continue to function 
normally while the OAD is in progress. This means that the application sends
mesh advertisement payloads while still connected to the OAD distributor.

If **on-chip** OAD is used, the Bluetooth mesh stack will not operate
concurrently with the BLE connection once the OAD has started. In this case, the
BLE connection is prioritized to complete the OAD and all mesh operations will 
resume once the device restarts and the OAD is completed successfully.

.. warning:: Proxy mesh nodes do not support the OAD feature. Proxy nodes use 
             the GATT bearer to translate mesh network information to legacy BLE
             devices. For this reason, it cannot also be used to perform an OAD.
