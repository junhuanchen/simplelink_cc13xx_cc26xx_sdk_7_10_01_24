Overview
========

This section describes the functionality of the Bluetooth Mesh features and
provides a list of APIs to interface with Bluetooth Mesh. The TI Mesh offering
consists of Mesh models, provisioning and an example application.

TI Bluetooth Mesh is implemented on top of the Zephyr Mesh project. For more
information on this, refer to :ref:`ti-ble-mesh-zephyr`.

Introduction
------------

A general mesh network has a many-to-many topology, where each device is able to
communicate with every other device in the mesh network. Communication is
achieved using messages, and devices are able to relay messages to other devices
so that the end-to-end communication range is extended far beyond the radio
range of each individual node.

Basic communication over a mesh network is based on flooding. This means that
each node acts as a relay node, forwarding all messages that have been received
(except messages designated to the local node). Managed flooding is a related
term and means that :term:`time to live` and message caching mechanisms are
implemented. This is used to reduce the flooded traffic over the network.
Enhanced implementations include management of forward paths to further optimize
the forwarded traffic load.

The Mesh network support over Bluetooth is standardized by the Bluetooth SIG in
the `Bluetooth Mesh specifications`_ and defines fundamental requirements to
enable an interoperable mesh networking solution for Bluetooth low energy
wireless technology.


Bluetooth Mesh Basics
---------------------

Layers of Bluetooth Mesh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:numref:`stack-layers` shows the layers of Bluetooth Mesh. Starting from the
bottom up, the Bluetooth Mesh standard enables overlay of a complete protocol
stack on top of a Bluetooth LE protocol stack.  The BLE-Stack provides bearer
services, both connectionless (advertisement based) or connection-oriented (GATT
based) connectivity. At the GATT bearers' level, Bluetooth Mesh is seen as a
profile where attributes are used to exchange mesh data.

    Layers of Bluetooth Mesh

Starting from the bottom, the Bluetooth Mesh protocol stack layers provide the 
following functionalities and services:

* **The bearer layer**

	* Transport of network messages between connection-less nodes (advertisement
	  based) and the connection bearers (GATT based)

* **The network layer**

	* Network addressing of transport messages towards one or more elements
	  (unicast/group/virtual)
	* Network message format definition which allows transport PDUs to be
	  transported by the bearer layer
	* Network message handling including relay/forward, accept further
	  processing, or reject message.
	* Encryption and authentication of network messages

* **The lower transport layer**

	* Segmentation and reassembly of upper transport layer messages into
	  multiple lower transport PDUs to deliver large upper transport layer
	  messages to other nodes

* **The upper transport layer**

	* Encryption and authentication of application data for providing
	  confidentiality of access messages
	* Control messages for managing the upper transport layer between nodes

* **The access layer**

	* Definition of how higher layer applications can use the upper transport
	  layer and how to format the application data
	* Definition and control of the application data encryption and decryption
	  performed in the upper transport layer
	* Validation of whether incoming application data has been received in the
	  context of the correct network and with correct application keys before
	  forwarding it to the higher layers.

* **The foundation model layer**

	* Definition of the states, messages, and models required to configure and
	  manage a mesh network

* **The model layer**

	* Definition of models that are used to standardize the operation of typical
	  user scenarios and are defined in the Bluetooth Mesh Model specification
	  or other higher layer specifications


Network Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Bluetooth Mesh specifications`_ defines a managed flood-based mesh network,
which uses broadcast channels to transmit messages so that nodes can receive
messages and relay these messages, thus extending the range of the original
message. Any device in a managed flood mesh network can send a message at any
time as long as there is a sufficient density of devices that are listening and
relaying messages. Under the managed flooding, message caching is used to
discard and not forward a message that has already been accepted. In addition,
packet time to live (:term:`TTL`) is used to limit the number of hops a packet
can be forwarded in the mesh network.

The Bluetooth Mesh network topology is built of different mesh nodes types:

* **Mesh node**: A member of a mesh network. It includes basic node
  functionality for receiving and processing broadcast, multicast and unicast
  messages designated for the node as well as transmission of local mesh data.
* **Mesh relay node**: Local processing as well as mesh message relaying for
  range extension within a mesh network. (Multiple hops supported)
* **Mesh proxy node**: Proxying between GATT-Bearer and Advertise bearer. This
  allows transmission to devices that support GATT-bearer only (e.g. mobiles
  phones).
* **Mesh low power node** (:term:`LPN`): A power limited node which wakes up on
  specific time intervals to send messages or receive messages which are
  aggregated by a designated friend node.
* **Mesh friend node**: Used to aggregate messages for :term:`LPN` during their
  sleep cycles and deliver their messages upon wake-up.

Note that Bluetooth LE devices that are connected to a mesh proxy node are not
counted as part of the Bluetooth Mesh network.

Node combinations are allowed over the same device. For example, one device can
be a Friend and Relay node.


Provisioning
""""""""""""

Provisioning is the process of adding the devices into a mesh network. A device
that is not a member of a mesh network is known as an unprovisioned device.

A provisioner is used to add a device to the network and manage the transitions
between unprovisioned devices and a (provisioned) mesh node via the provisioning
protocol. Provisioning of devices into a mesh network differs from the pairing
and bonding process that is typically used in Bluetooth wireless technology.

There are two provisioning bearers (PBs) for provisioning protocol messages:

- PB-ADV bearer (connectionless oriented): This vector is implemented on all
  Bluetooth mesh nodes. 
- PB-GATT bearer (connection oriented): This vector is only implemented on mesh
  proxy nodes. This feature allows Bluetooth LE devices (which do not support
  advertising bearers), such as mobile phones, to act as provisioners.

For more information on Provisioning, please see the `Provisioning Procedures`_
section below.

Node Configuration
""""""""""""""""""

A mesh node is managed by a Configuration Client to configure how the node
communicates with other nodes. A Configuration Client can remove a node from a
mesh network, which reverts it back to an unprovisioned device. The
Configuration Client can be the same device as the provisioner.

For more information on node configuration, please see :ref:`node_configuration`.

Elements and Models
"""""""""""""""""""

An element is an addressable entity within a node. Each node has at least one
element, the primary element, and may have one or more additional secondary
elements.

Each element has one or several Models. A model defines the basic functionality
of a node by defining the required states, the messages that act upon those
states, and any associated behavior. A node may include multiple models.
Foundation configuration and health server models are mandatory in every node.

.. figure:: resources/node_element.png
    :align: center
    :width: 65%

    Node - Element - Model - State

To recap:

* **Node**: One device
* **Element**: Addressable entity in the network
* **Model**: Implements functionality
* **State**: Contains the condition of a model


Data Distribution
"""""""""""""""""

Publication and subscription of data within the mesh network uses a
publish-subscribe paradigm. Nodes that generate messages publish the messages to
a single address. Nodes that are interested in receiving the message will
subscribe to this address. Generated messages are sent to destination mesh
addresses that can be unicast (associated with a single element), pre-configured
group addresses, or virtual addresses. Messages can be sent as replies to other
messages or can be unsolicited messages. When an instance of a model is sending
a reply message, it uses the incoming message originatorâ€™s source address as the
destination address. This way only the originator will receive this message.
When an instance of a model is sending unsolicited messages, it uses a model
publish address as the destination address. Each instance of a model within a
node has a single publish address.

For more information on this, navigate to `Message handling`_

Client - Server - Control
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

As in GATT, Bluetooth Mesh messages follow a Client - Server architecture:

* A Server is a Node that exposes an Element and stores the condition of all the
  states associated.
* A Client can interact with Elements through requests to the Server.

The models are thus divided into Server Models, Client Models and Control Models:

* **Server Model**: Contains states associated to the model and elements. Also
  contains rules for how the model will react to incoming requests.
* **Client Model**: Contains definitions of messages used for read, write and
  other requests from the Client to the Server.
* **Control Model**: A control model can contain server models, client models
  and rules for interactions between these.


Security
^^^^^^^^

As per the `Bluetooth Mesh specifications`_, security in a Bluetooth mesh
network is mandatory.

All messages in the mesh network are encrypted and authenticated using two types
of keys. One key type is for the network layer communication. This ensures that
all communication within a mesh network uses the same network key. The other key
type is for application data, used to secure payloads at the upper transport
layer. Separating the keys for networking and applications allows sensitive
access messages (e.g. for access control to a building) to be separated from
non-sensitive access messages (e.g. for lighting).

In addition, the network security model utilizes a privacy mechanism called
:wikipedia:`obfuscation <Obfuscation_(software)>` which utilizes the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt the source address, sequence numbers, and
other header information using a private key. The intent for obfuscation is to
make tracking nodes more difficult.

Bluetooth Mesh networks also protect against :wikipedia:`replay attacks <Replay_attack>`.
A replay attack happens when a malicious third party eavesdrops on the
communication of a mesh network with the aim to intercept secure network
communication and resend secure payloads. The goal of the attacker is to
misdirect the recipient of the message by *replaying* or resending a payload,
hoping the recipient believes the source of the payload is genuine. In this way,
the attacker can extract secure data from the recipient or perform a malicious
task. For example, the malicious user may replay a message to try to switch on
the lights in the middle of the night. Message sequence numbers and an
:term:`IV Index` are added to mesh network payloads to protect against replay
attacks. Each mesh message has its own 24-bit sequence number. The sequence
number is incremented each time a message is sent. If a node receives a message
with an old sequence number, the node will discard the payload. Similar to
sequence numbers, an :term:`IV Index` is a separate field inside the network
payload. When a node receives a message, it will also check the :term:`IV Index`
value for validity. In short, the :term:`IV Index` must always be equal to or
greater than the last valid message sent to that node. The :term:`IV Index`
itself is protected by encryption and CRC performed when a node is added to a
network and is not easily modifiable by an attacker.

Additional security measures are defined in the `Bluetooth Mesh specifications`_
that protect a mesh network from nodes removed from the network so that these
expired nodes cannot be used to attack the network, i.e. a trashcan attack.
To protect against this, the specification implements a reject list that the
provisioner maintains. When a node is ready to leave the network, the
provisioner adds the node to the reject list and initiates the Key Refresh
Procedure. The Key Refresh Procedure is initiated by the provisioner and it
assigns new keys to all the nodes in the network.

Nodes may also make use of Secure Network Beacons, which are used to indicate
the security status of a node. The Secure Network Beacon is sent to update a
network with an updated IV index and to expect a Key Refresh Procedure.

For more information regarding Bluetooth Mesh Security, please review Section
3.8 **Mesh security** of the Mesh Profile `Bluetooth Mesh specifications`_.

.. tip:: TI's Bluetooth Mesh solution implements the above security model as
				 defined by the specification inside the stack. As such, a developer
				 need not worry about implementing at the application layer.


TI Bluetooth Mesh Software Architecture
---------------------------------------

.. _mesh-architecture:
.. figure:: resources/mesh-architecture.png
    :align: center
    :width: 60%

    TI Bluetooth Mesh High-level Software Architecture

As shown above in :numref:`mesh-architecture`, TI's Bluetooth mesh solution
consists of 3 core functional components:

* BLE5 Stack - Bluetooth LE protocol stack implementation
* Bluetooth Mesh Stack - Bluetooth Mesh protocol stack implementation
* Bluetooth Mesh Application - User application implementation

|BLE5_STACK| is at the foundation of the Bluetooth Mesh implementation. The
Bluetooth Mesh stack uses the |BLE5_STACK| services for transporting data over
GATT based connection oriented data channels and Advertisement based
connection-less channels. For example, the traditional broadcaster role is used
by nodes to send packets over the advertisement (ADV) bearer. In parallel, the
observer role is used by nodes to receive packets by passively scanning.
Finally, the peripheral/central roles are used by nodes in the Proxy
configuration to communicate with legacy Bluetooth LE devices over the GATT
bearer. 

Our Bluetooth Mesh stack is implemented on top of the `Zephyr Project`_'s
Bluetooth Mesh stack. For more information on this, refer to
:ref:`ti-ble-mesh-zephyr`.

The Bluetooth Mesh application is the core interface for users to control and
manage the Bluetooth Mesh functionality. Here, specific node configurations and
models are defined and used by each node in a mesh network.

Alongside the stack, additional OS services and Drivers/Middleware are used by
the application. These functional components consist of TI Drivers and TI-RTOS.

.. note:: Currently, only certain SIG-defined Models and Vendor Models are
          supported.

Provisioning Procedures
-----------------------

The following section describes the provisioning procedure for both PB-ADV and
PB-GATT bearers.

Provisioning with PB-ADV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _provision-pb-adv:
.. figure:: resources/provision-pb-adv.png
    :align: center
	
    Provisioning over PB_ADV high level overview

:numref:`provision-pb-adv` shows provisioning over the advertisement bearer
(PB-ADV). Here, we can see there is no connection establishment. All
communication occurs through advertisements, as the name suggests. Once the mesh
application has been initialized, **MeshApp_unprovisioned_beacon()** is called
to enable Provisioning. Then unprovisioned beacon advertisments are sent until
a separate device (i.e.  the Provisioning Client) receives the unprovisioned
beacon. At this time, the stack handles any response and the provisioning
process until the device is successfully provisioned. At the application level,
the user simply waits until the **prov_complete_cbk()** is called.

.. note:: The application defines the provision complete callback by default
 		  and is modifiable via SysConfig. Check the SysConfig file inside BLE
 		  Mesh->Provisioning Data Configuration-> Complete Callback Name.

Provisioning with PB-GATT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _provision-pb-gatt:
.. figure:: resources/provision-pb-gatt.png
    :align: center
	
    Provisioning over PB_GATT high level overview

:numref:`provision-pb-gatt` shows provisioning over the GATT bearer (PB-GATT),
which is used by Proxy configured nodes. To provision over PB-GATT, the mesh
Proxy node must first send connectable advertisements. Once the mesh application
has been initialized, **MeshApp_unprovisioned_beacon()** is called to enable
Provisioning. From here, the mesh Proxy node waits for the provisioner to
initiate a connection. Once the connection is established, provisioning beacons
are sent to the provisioner, this time, using the GATT bearer. At this time,
the stack handles any response and the provisioning process until the device
is successfully provisioned. At the application level, the user simply waits
until the **prov_complete_cbk()** is called.

Once provisioned, the Mesh Stack will trigger a disconnect. This is done so the
node can then expose its Bluetooth Proxy Service, as defined in the
`Bluetooth Mesh specifications`_.

Message handling
----------------

The following section describes how messages are sent/received by the Bluetooth
mesh stack. One important note here is that application data is only decrypted
at the target destination with a valid, separate application key. The target
destination may be a Group Address the node has subscribed to, or it can be the
Unicast address of a particular node/model.

Relay node processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _relay-rx:
.. figure:: resources/relay-rx.png
    :align: center
	
    Inbound Relay Data processing

As shown above in :numref:`relay-rx`, when a mesh node publishes to an address
in a network, it sends advertisement PDUs over the air. When a mesh node
receives this PDU, the message is received by the stack and processed. Here, the
network key is used to determine the message's target destination. If the target
address is a Group Address or received by a relay node, the mesh node will
relay this information to the Mesh stack, and the advertisement PDU will be
sent back out to the mesh network/target address. This process is shown below
in :numref:`relay-tx`

.. _relay-tx:
.. figure:: resources/relay-tx.png
    :align: center
	
    Outbound Relay Data processing

Proxy node processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Proxy Nodes request data over the GATT bearer, so an additional step is required
for proxy configured nodes when receiving messages.

.. _proxy-rx:
.. figure:: resources/proxy-rx.png
    :align: center
	
    Inbound Proxy Data processing

First, the *Peer GATT node* must submit a request for data from the mesh
network. When the mesh stack receives this message, it will trigger a callback
to the application and the *Mesh Stack* will request that data from the
*Mesh Net*. Once received, it will forward this message using a GATT tx to the
*Peer GATT node*.

.. _proxy-tx:
.. figure:: resources/proxy-tx.png
    :align: center
	
    Outbound Proxy Data processing

Similar to the Inbound Proxy Data process, a mesh Proxy node waits for its
*Peer GATT node* to send it a message before forwarding it to the *Mesh Net*.
