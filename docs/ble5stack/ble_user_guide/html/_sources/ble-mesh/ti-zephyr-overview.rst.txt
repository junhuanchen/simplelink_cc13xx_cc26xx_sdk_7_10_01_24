TI Bluetooth Mesh and the Zephyr Project
========================================

Here we will go over a high level overview of how Bluetooth Mesh builds on top
of |BLE5_STACK|, including a stack architecture diagram to show how the 
`Zephyr Project`_'s Bluetooth Mesh stack is used in parallel with our current 
|BLE5_STACK|.

    TI Bluetooth Mesh and Zephyr Stack Architecture

As shown above in :numref:`mesh-zephyr-architecture`, TI's Bluetooth Mesh 
implementation ports over the Zephyr Mesh Stack while still leveraging our 
existing |BLE5_STACK| for use on embedded devices. For this reason, we only use
Zephyr's mesh stack functionality and not the BLE stack layers 
(i.e. Host/Controller). The porting layer serves as a translator that allows us
to use both the Zephyr mesh stack along with the |BLE5_STACK|. Put simply, this
layer converts Zephyr mesh specific API calls to the relevant |BLE5_STACK| API
call.

:numref:`mesh-zephyr-porting` shows an example of how the porting layer 
translates Zephyr mesh API's to the appropriate |BLE5_STACK| APIs.
