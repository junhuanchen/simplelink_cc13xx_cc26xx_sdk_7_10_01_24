TI BLE5-Stack Quick Start
*************************

This section serves as a road map for users developing applications
and products using the TI SimpleLink |DEVICE| wireless MCU platform for
Bluetooth Low Energy applications. Whether a seasoned developer or just getting
started, TI has created a variety of resources to simplify development on the
|DEVICE| platform. These resources will enhance your experience with the TI
SimpleLink |BLE5_STACK| |version| from the out-of-the-box demo to production.

To download the |DEVICE| SDK, please visit the download page:
`http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC13XX-CC26XX-SDK <http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC13XX-CC26XX-SDK>`_.

:numref:`fig_ble5_suggested_workflow` shows the suggested work flow for getting
started with TI's SimpleLink Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) development environment.

    Suggested Workflow

.. note::
    The BLE5-Stack component of the SDK now supports secure OAD and use it by
    default. In order to maintain compatibility with other stacks, the Quick
    Start Guide will cover **unsecure** OAD. For more information regarding
    secure OAD, see the **OAD Chapter** of the BLE5-Stack User's Guide.

.. _get-started-ble5-ccs:

Using BLE5-Stack Projects with CCS
==================================

For BLE5-Stack projects, the BLE5-Stack is linked as library files. The
``host_test`` project is an exception to this, and use the split Stack library
configuration. This means that importing the BLE5-Stack project into CCS will
also import a BLE5-Stack library project. The stack library project is a
dependent project and will be automatically built when the example project is
built.

Projects that contain the TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD) Profile will require
you to flash your device with the Boot Image Manager (BIM) hex file. This is
the first step described in section `Build and Download` below. For more
information on the TI OAD Profile and the BIM see the **OAD Chapter** of the
BLE5-Stack User's Guide.

For more details and how to
change configurations look at the SimpleLink |BLE5_STACK| User’s Guide.

Import Project Using Resource Explorer
--------------------------------------

A quick and easy way to start working with the SDK is to use the TI Resource
Explorer in CCS.

This section describes how to import and build an existing project and
references the ``project_zero`` project. All of |BLE5_STACK| projects included
in the development kit have a similar structure.

#. Open the CCS IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Create a workspace.

    .. attention::

        Ensure that the CCS workspace path does not contain a whitespace.

#. Import a CCS Project using Resource Explorer

    - Open Resource Explorer (if not open already): View -> Resource Explorer
    - Navigate to the CCS folder for your chosen example:
      Software |rarr| |SDK| |rarr| Examples |rarr| Development Tools |rarr|
      |LP| |rarr| BLE5-Stack |rarr| project_zero |rarr| TI-RTOS |rarr|
      CCS Compiler |rarr| project_zero

    .. _fig-ccs-import-projects:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5_ccs_import_project_zero.png
        :align: center

        Import CCS Projects

#.  Select the CCS Logo button to import project into Project Explorer

    .. attention::

        The import process will also install the |SDK| if a local version does
        not exist. You must accept the End User License Agreement to proceeed.

        .. _fig-resource-explorer-eula:
        .. figure:: resources/eula.png
            :align: center

            Install |SDK|

        After the installation finishes, you must reopen CCS before importing
        the project.

    - If everything is successful, the project should appear in Resource
      Explorer: project_zero_app_CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs.

        Projects Imported into CCS


Build and Download Project
--------------------------

.. note::

    * For projects with the stack as a library, the Stack project should always
      be built before the Application project.
    * For projects containing the TI OAD Profile, it is recommended to build
      the BIM first. A pre-built BIM hex file is also available, and can be
      used as instructed below.

To build & download Project Zero:

#. Flash the BIM hex file.

    - The hex file can be found in examples |rarr| nortos |rarr| |LP|
      |rarr| bim |rarr| hexfiles |rarr| bim_offchip |rarr| Debug_unsecure
    - Use Smart RF Flash Programmer 2 or Uniflash_ to program the hex file.

#. Build the Application project.

    - Set the Application project as the active project.
    - Select **Project -> Build All** to build the Application project.
    - As part of the prebuild process, SysConfig will run and generate code
      based on the ``.syscfg`` in the workspace. For more information on
      SysConfig, see the SysConfig chapter of the User's Guide.

#. Load the Application project

    - Select **Run** -> **Debug** to download the application

Before beginning execution, open a terminal window with the following settings:

    When using CCS compiler, modifying ``.xscfg``  files has no effect.

.. _get-started-ble5-iar:

Using BLE5-Stack Projects with IAR
==================================

When building with IAR, it is recommended to enable all build messages. This
can be done by right-clicking in the Build window and selecting "All" as shown
below:

    .. _fig-ble5-iar-enable-build-messages:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5_iar_enable_build_messages.png

        Enable All Build Messages

.. warning::
    Standalone SysConfig tool must be installed in order to use all the IAR projects and
    its location has to the same as specified by ``SYSCONFIG_ROOT``.

    The SysConfig standalone package can be found here: `SysConfig Standalone Installer Download Page`_.

Import Project Using Workspace
------------------------------

This section describes how to open and build an existing project and references
the project\_zero project.

.. warning::
    In this release of the |SDK| all of the |BLE5_STACK| examples have been
    converted to the same structure as the TI Drivers examples.

    This means that the global argument variables should always be used.

    +-------------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
    | **Custom Argvars type** | **BLE5 Projects**               | **Keep in mind**                               |

    +-------------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

    Below you can see how to add and enable the SDK-global argument variables:

    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_menu.png

        Select Configure Custom Argument Variables from the Tools menu


    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_empty.png

        Click on Import... with either the Workspace or Global namespace
        selected. For Global, the imported values will persist for other
        projects also.


    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_file.png

        Find the Custom Argument Variables file under ``<SDK root>/tools/iar``


    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_selected.png

        Success! Change these paths if you have installed in a different location.



Some of the |BLE5_STACK| workspace included in the |SDK| have an Application
project and a Stack Library project. Some have only an Application project.

In addition, applications containing the TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD) Profile
will also include the Boot Image Manager (BIM) project. For more
information on the TI OAD Profile and the BIM see the OAD Chapter of the
BLE5-Stack User's Guide.

.. note::
    If you have imported the global
    ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``,
    then the examples from the older SDK or CC2640R2 SDK examples will fail to build. Therefore,
    you must remove this custom_argvars file from your IAR global custom arguments if you
    are working on multiple version of SDKs.

#. Open the IAR Embedded Workbench IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Open an IAR workspace project: **File** -> **Open** -> **Workspace...**

    - For this example, select
      *<SDK\_INSTALL\_DIR>\\examples\\rtos\\|LP|\\ble5stack\\project\_zero\\tirtos\\iar\\project_zero_app.template.eww*

#. This will prompt you to select a folder location as a workspace for the
   project

Running the Demo
================

After hitting the play button, your terminal window should display the Project
Zero initialization information as shown below:

    .. _fig-ble5_pz_terminal_initialization:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5_pz_terminal_initialization.png
        :align: center

        Project Zero Initialization

This provides information about the services present in Project Zero. Project
Zero has 4 interactive services: the LED service, the button service, the data
service, and the OAD service.

Writing a non-zero value to the LED service will cause the LEDs on the LaunchPad
to light up. Writing zero will turn them off. Enabling notifications on the
Button service will cause the Peripheral to send notifications of current button
state (0 - not pressed, 1 - pressed) to the Central device. The Data service can
be used to read and write multiple bytes of data. The OAD service can be used
for updating the image currently running on the LaunchPad.

Choose the Central device from the list below to connect with:

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        **Click to Expand BTool Instructions**

    **Host Test Setup**

    The easiest way to connect to Project Zero with another CC13xx/CC26xx
    LaunchPad is by using BTool. BTool allows you to send HCI commands to
    the LaunchPad to easily establish BLE communication with another device.

    To use BTool, you must flash your second |LP| with the Host Test
    firmware from a compatible version of the TI BLE-Stack/BLE5-Stack.
    Pre-built Host Test binaries are included in the ble5stack examples
    directory of the SDK.

    Uniflash can be used to program the LaunchPad with the Host Test firmware:

    .. _fig-ble5-uniflash-host-test:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5-uniflash-host-test.png
        :align: center

        Flash Host Test using Uniflash

    Open BTool from the ``tools\ble5stack\btool`` folder of the SDK\_INSTALL\_DIR.
    **Start BTool by double clicking Run_BTool.bat**
    Select the XDS110 UART COM Port for your Host Test LaunchPad:

    .. _fig-btool_serial_port:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/btool_serial_port.png
        :align: center

        BTool Serial Port Settings

    When BTool connects to the LaunchPad, it will issue several initialization
    commands. If the commands succeed, you will receive multiple HCI Events with
    a Status of "SUCCESS".

    **Connect to Project Zero**

    Scan for nearby advertising Bluetooth devices by selecting the Scan button
    in the Discovery window. Make sure your Project Zero LaunchPad is
    connected to power and advertising.

    Compare the device addresses in the Slave BDA dropdown with the address
    shown in the Project Zero terminal window. Select the matching address and
    click "Establish" to connect to Project Zero.

    .. _fig-btool-scan-connect:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/btool-scan-connect.png
        :align: center

        Scanning & Connecting with BTool

    After the connection has established, discover & read the current value of
    the services and characteristics available on Project Zero by right-clicking
    on the Handle in the Connection Info section and selecting Read Values.

    .. _fig-btool-read-values:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/btool-read-values.png

        Turning on Project Zero LEDs

    **Using the Button Service**

    You can choose to receive notifications about the current state of the
    Project Zero Button Service by writing 01:00 to the Client Characteristic
    Configuration Descriptors of the Button Service. After enabling
    notifications, the current value of the Button state will be displayed in
    BTool.

    **Using the Data Service**

    You can read and write multiple bytes of data by using the Data Service.
    Double click on the Value field of the String Char. You can write the new
    value directly in ASCII or you can choose a different type by selecting from
    the Value Type dropdown menu.

        Data Service Value change

    **Using the OAD Service**

    Project Zero includes the TI OAD Profile which allows you to download new
    firmware images over-the-air. Images must be compatible with the |DEVICE|
    and contain the TI OAD Profile in order to be downloaded successfully. For
    more information on creating a new image for OAD, please see the OAD Chapter
    of the BLE5-Stack User's Guide.

    .. note::
        If Project Zero was not the first image containing the TI OAD Profile you
        flashed on your LaunchPad Out-of-the-Box, the factory image in your
        external flash may not be Project Zero. This could mean that you will be
        unable to return to Project Zero by using the factory reset option after
        performing an OAD and will have to use the debugger to load a new image.

        Refer to the Project Zero README for more information about this project
        and resetting the factory image contained in external flash.

    In BTool, choose Over The Air Download in the "Select Device Operation" box.
    In this demo, we will use Project Zero as our example since a valid image
    was created during the build process.

    Select the new image to load on your |LP| by clicking ``Read Image
    File``. Navigate to your Project Zero build output directory. Select the
    ``*_oad.bin`` file. The ``*_oad.bin`` file will contain a valid image header.

    BTool will send a connection parameter update at the
    beginning of an OAD to attempt a faster download. The embedded application
    will also attempt a parameter update (if enabled). It is recommended to wait
    until the application's connection parameter update has taken place before
    starting an OAD. If you are experiencing a slow OAD, this may be the cause.
    The parameter update is complete once the following message is shown in the
    BTool log:

    .. code-block:: none
