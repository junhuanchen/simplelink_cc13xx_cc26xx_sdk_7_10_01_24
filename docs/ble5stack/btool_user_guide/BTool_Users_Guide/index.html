<h1>Using BTool<a class="headerlink" href="#using-btool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>BTool is a PC Application that allows a user to form a connection between two
BLE devices. BTool works by  communicating  with  the  CC26x2R LaunchPad,
acting  as  a network  processor, by  means  of  HCI  vendor  specific commands.
This requires the CC2642R to be running the Host Test sample application.</p>
<p>More information on the network processor configuration can be found in the
Bluetooth low energy Software Developer’s Guide. More information on the Host
Test sample application can be found in the Host Test overview. More information
on the HCI interface, as well as details on the HCI vendor specific commands
that are used by the CC26x2R LaunchPad can be found in the TI BLE Vendor
Specific HCI Guide.</p>
<p>For this section, a PC running Windows 7 has been used, but the procedures are
essentially the same for other Windows versions.</p>
<section id="starting-the-application">
<h2>Starting the Application<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-the-application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a CC2642R has been connected to the PC via USB, upon opening BTool, you
should be able to set the Serial Port
Settings. Set the “Port” value to the COM Port number associated with “XDS110
Class Application/User.” For the other settings, use the default values as shown
in <a class="reference internal" href="#btool-serial-port-settings"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a>.</p>

<p>When BTool has a serial connection to the LaunchPad, you should see the screen
presented in <a class="reference internal" href="#btool-connected-screen"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a>. This
screen indicates that you now have a serial port connection to the CC26x2R
LaunchPad. The screen is divided up into a few sections. The left sidebar
contains information on the status of the connected device. The left side of the
sub-window contains a log of all messages sent from BTool to the CC2642R
LaunchPad and received by BTool from the CC26x2R LaunchPad. The right side
of the sub-window contains a GUI for control of the CC26x2R LaunchPad.</p>

<p>At this point, the CC26x2R LaunchPad (central device) is ready to discover
other BLE devices that are advertising. This section will use a CC2642R
running the Simple Peripheral sample application as the peripheral device that is
being connected to. More information on running this project can be found in the
Bluetooth low energy Software Developer’s Guide and the Simple Peripheral sample

<p>As devices are found, the log on the left side of the screen will
display the devices that are discovered. After 10 seconds, the device discovery
process will complete, and the device running Host Test will stop scanning. A
summary of all of the scanned devices will be displayed in the log window. In
the example in <a class="reference internal" href="#btool-discovered-devices"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 4</span></a>, 19 peripheral devices were
discovered while scanning. If you
do not want to wait through the full 10 seconds of scanning, the “Cancel” button
can be pressed to stop the device discovery process. The

<section id="selecting-connection-parameters">
<h3>Selecting Connection Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-connection-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before establishing a connection, you can set up the desired connection
parameters. The default values of 100ms  connection  interval, 0 peripheral
latency, and 20s supervision timeout should serve as a good starting point;
however for different applications you may want to experiment with other values.</p>
<p>Once the desired values have been set, be sure to click the “Set” button;
otherwise the settings will not be saved. Note that the connection parameters
must be set before a connection is established; changing the values and clicking
the “Set” button while a connection is active will not change the settings of an
active connection. The connection must be terminated and re-established to use
the new parameters. (The Bluetooth specification does support connection
parameter updates while a connection is active; however this must be done using
either an L2CAP connection parameter update request, or using a direct HCI
command. More information can be found in the Specification of the Bluetooth
System).</p>

<section id="simple-peripheral-profiles">
<h2>Simple Peripheral Profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-peripheral-profiles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Simple Peripheral application contains several GATT service profiles (more
information can be found in the Simple Peripheral Sample Application Guide).
GATT services contain data values known as “characteristic values.” All
application data that is being sent or received in Bluetooth low energy must be
contained within characteristic values. This section details a step-by-step
process that demonstrates several processes for reading, writing, discovering,
and notifying GATT characteristic values using BTool.</p>
<p>In a Bluetooth low energy system, upon connection, the the central device
(client) performs a service discovery on the peripheral device (server) to
build up an attribute table. This attribute table will provide handles
(internal addresses of the characteristics) which can be used by the client to
access the data located in the server. The device discovery is typically an
automated process that can be started with a single command. In BTool, this can
be done by right clicking on “Handle” (under “Connection Info” on the left side
of the screen) and then selecting “Discover UUIDs”.</p>
<section id="reading-a-characteristic-value-by-uuid">
<h3>Reading a Characteristic Value by UUID<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-a-characteristic-value-by-uuid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A characteristic value is essentially where the data is stored, which could be,
for example, temperature data or battery level. It’s the stored data in a
server that a client wants to access. A characteristic is a discrete value that
has the following three properties associated with it:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A handle (address)</p></li>
<li><p>A type (UUID)</p></li>
<li><p>A set of permissions</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The simplest way to read its value is to use the “Read Characteristic by UUID”
sub-procedure. To do this, you will first need to click the “Read Write” option
in BTool under “Select Device Operation” in the upper left corner.
Select the option “Read Using Characteristic UUID” under the”sub-procedure”
option in the “Characteristic Read” section at the top of the screen. Enter the
UUID (note that the LSB is entered first, and the MSB is entered last) in the
“Characteristic UUID” box, and click the “Read” button. An attribute protocol
Read by Type Request packet gets sent over the air from the Host Test device to
the Simple Peripheral device, and an attribute protocol Read by Type Response
packet gets sent back from the Simple Peripheral device to the Host Test device.
The characteristic value is displayed in the “Value” box, and “Success” is
displayed in the “Status” box. In addition, the message window will display
information on the Read by Type Response packet that was received by the
Host Test device. The message includes not only the characteristic’s data
value, but also the handle of the characteristic value.</p>
</section>
<section id="reading-a-characteristic-value-by-handle">
<h3>Reading a Characteristic Value by Handle<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-a-characteristic-value-by-handle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is also possible to read the characteristic value if the handle is known.
This is done by selecting the option “Read Characteristic Value/Descriptor”
under the “Sub-Procedure” option in the “Characteristic Read” section. Enter the
handle into the “Characteristic Value Handle” box and click the “Read” button to
execute the read.</p>
<p>An attribute protocol Read Request packet gets sent over the air from the Host
Test device to the Simple Peripheral device, and an attribute protocol Read
Response packet gets sent back from the Simple Peripheral device to the Host
Test device. The new value is
displayed in the “Value” box, and “Success” is displayed in the “Status” box.
This value should match the value that was written in the previous step for the
same characteristic.</p>
</section>
<section id="writing-a-characteristic-value">
<h3>Writing a Characteristic Value<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-a-characteristic-value" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a characteristic has write permission, it is possible for a client to write a
value to the server. This is done in the “Characteristic Write” section by
entering the handle in the “Characteristic Value Handle” box and the value in
the “Value” section (the format can be set to either “Decimal” or “Hex”). The
write operation is performed when the “Write Value” button is clicked.</p>
<p>An attribute protocol Write Request packet gets sent over the air from the Host
Test device to the Simple Peripheral, and an attribute protocol Write Response
packet gets sent back from the Simple Peripheral device to the Host Test device.
The status box will display “Success”, indicating that the write was successful.</p>
</section>
<section id="discovering-a-characteristic-by-uuid">
<h3>Discovering a Characteristic by UUID<a class="headerlink" href="#discovering-a-characteristic-by-uuid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By discovering a characteristic by UUID, not only will the handle of the UUID be
obtained, but the properties of the characteristic (handle and permission) will
as well. The operation is performed by selecting the option “Discover
Characteristic by UUID” under the “Sub-Procedure” option in the “Characteristic
Read” section at the top of the screen. The discovery is performed when the UUID
is entered into the “Characteristic UUID” box, and the “Read” button is clicked.</p>
<p>A series of attribute protocol Read by Type Request packets get sent over the
air over the air from the Host Test device to the Simple Peripheral device, and
for each request an attribute protocol Read by Type Response packet gets sent
back from the Simple Peripheral device to the Host Test device. Essentially, the
the Host Test device is reading every attribute on the Simple Peripheral device
with a UUID of 0x2803 (this is the UUID for a characteristic declaration), and
checking the “Characteristic Value UUID” portion of each declaration to see if
it matches the UUID type you’ve entered. The procedure is complete once every
characteristic declaration has been read.</p>
<p>As per the Bluetooth specification, the first byte presents the properties of
the characteristic. The second and third bytes present the handle of the
characteristic value. The fourth and fifth bytes present the UUID of the
characteristic.</p>
</section>
<section id="reading-multiple-characteristic-values">
<h3>Reading Multiple Characteristic Values<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-multiple-characteristic-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is also possible to read multiple characteristic values with one request, as
long as the handle of each value is known. To read several values from different
characteristics, select the option “Read Multiple Characteristic Values” under
the “Sub-Procedure option” in the “Characteristic Read” section at the top of the
screen. Enter the handle with the semicolon separation (ie. “0x0022;0x0025”) in
the “Characteristic Value Handle” box, and click the “Run” button.</p>
<p>An attribute protocol Read Multiple Request packet gets sent over the air from
the host Test device to the Simple Peripheral device, and an attribute protocol
Read Multiple Response packet gets sent back from the Simple Peripheral device
to the Host Test device. The values of the two characteristics are displayed in
the “Value” box, and “Success” is displayed in the “Status” box.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The response will not parse the separate values. This means that the size of
each value being read must be fixed, and must be known by the client. In the
example here, this is not an issue since there are only two bytes in the
response; however, care must be taken when using this command.</p>

<section id="enable-notifications">
<h3>Enable Notifications<a class="headerlink" href="#enable-notifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In BLE, it is possible for a GATT server device to “push” characteristic value
data out to a client device without being prompted with a read request. This
process is called “Characteristic Value Notification”. Notifications are useful
in that they allow a device in a BLE connection to send out as much or as little
data as required at any point in time. In addition, since no request from the
client is required, the overhead is reduced and the data is transmitted more
efficiently.</p>
<p>In order to enable notifications, the client device must write a
value of 0x0001 to the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD) for
the particular characteristic. The handle for the CCCD immediately follows the
characteristic value’s handle. Therefore, a value of 0x0001 must be written to
the “handle + 1”.</p>

<p>The peripheral will send a pairing response in return, which will require a
six-digit passkey to be entered by the user in order to complete the process.
The IO Capabilities supported by each device (e.g. display only, keyboard +
display, etc) determine whether it is the peripheral or the central that
displays the passkey, according to <strong>Selecting Key Generation Method</strong> section
([Vol 3], Part H, Section 2.3.5.1) of the Bluetooth Core Specification Version
5.0. By displaying the passkey on one device and requiring the user to enter it
in the other device’s user interface, the link is authenticated, in that it has
been verified that the connection has not been hijacked using a
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.</p>
<p>If the peripheral displays the passkey, in the box labeled “Passkey” in the
“Passkey Input” section in BTool, enter the passkey value and click the “Send
Passkey” button as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#btool-sending-passkey"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10</span></a>. If BTool instead
displays a passkey in the box labeled “Passkey”, then enter this passkey into
the peripheral device. Note that if you do not send the passkey within 30
seconds after receiving the pairing response message, the pairing process will
fail, and you will need to re-send the pairing request.</p>

<h3>Using Bonding and Long-Term Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#using-bonding-and-long-term-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bonding is a feature in BLE that allows a device, after initial pairing with a
peer, to remember specific information about that peer device. In particular,
the long-term key data that is generated during the initial pairing process can
be stored locally. If the connection is then terminated and the two devices
later reconnect, this data can be used to quickly re-initiate encryption without
needing to go through the full pairing process and/or use a passkey. In
addition, if a client device had enabled notifications of any characteristics on
the server device while the two devices were bonded, the server device will
remember the setting and the client will not have to re-enable them.</p>
<p>After pairing has been completed with the bonding enabled, the “Long-term Key
(LTK) Data” will be populated with some of the data from the
“GAP_AuthenticationComplete” event that was generated during the encryption
process. This data is required for re-initiating encryption upon reconnect.
Click the “Save Long-term Key Data to File” button to save this information to
file. The data is saved in a “comma separated value” (CSV) format as simple
text, and can be stored anywhere on disk. Be sure to note the location that the
file is stored in.</p>

<p>Within the Simple Peripheral device, a similar process is going on, in that the
the Simple Peripheral sample application contains a bond manager that is storing
the long-term key data that it had generated during encryption. Since the Simple
Peripheral sample application does not have a file system, it is simply storing
the data in the nonvolatile memory of the CC2642R. More information on the bond
manager can be found in the Bluetooth low energy Software Developer’s Guide.
With a bond now active, you can enable notifications of a characteristic value
and have that setting remembered for later. Note that if notifications were
enabled before going through the pairing process, then the setting will not be
stored. Therefore, you will need to re-write the value “01:00” to a CCCD.
Because the devices are paired with bonding enabled, the bond manager in the
Simple Peripheral sample application will store the CCCD data in nonvolatile
memory.</p>
<p>To verify that bonding worked, you will need to disconnect and re-connect. Click
on the “Discover Connect” operation and click the “Terminate” button at the bottom of
the screen to disconnect from the Simple Peripheral device. The message window
will show a “GAP_TerminateLink” event with “Success” status as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#btool-terminate-link"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 13</span></a>. In addition, the connection information in the
upper-left corner of the screen will disappear.</p>

<p>At a later time, re-connect with the Simple Peripheral device following the procedure in
<a class="reference internal" href="#create-connection"><span class="std std-ref">Creating a Connection Between the CC26x2R LaunchPad and a Peripheral Device</span></a>. Note that the value of the CCCD for a characteristic
is always set back to “00:00” if a connection is terminated or if the device
resets.</p>
<p>To re-initiate encryption and re-enable any notifications that were enabled in
the previous connection, return to the “Pairing/Bonding” tab. In the “Encrypt
Using Long-Term Key” section, click the “Load Long-Term Key Data From File”
button, and select the file in which the data was previously stored. The data
fields will get automatically populated from the data in the file. Click the
“Encrypt Link” button to re-enable encryption as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#btool-re-encrypt-using-long-term-keys"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 14</span></a>.</p>

<p>A “GAP_BondComplete” event with “Success” status will be displayed in the log
window. This indicates that the link has been re-encrypted as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#btool-bonding-completed"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 15</span></a>. You will also now be able to receive any
notifications that were enabled in the previous connection. Any changes to the
CCCD value of a characteristic will be saved to nonvolatile memory and
remembered for the next time that encryption is initiated using the long-term
key.</p>
